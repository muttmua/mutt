Issues are used to report bugs in mutt.

Please use the [mutt-users mailing list](http://www.mutt.org/mail-lists.html) or
[#mutt IRC channel](https://gitlab.com/muttmua/mutt/-/wikis/MuttChannel) for
general help or questions.

Feature requests should be discussed on the mutt-dev mailing list
first.  Preferably include a link to the mutt-dev discussion in the
feature request.  If you open a feature request without discussing the
idea on mutt-dev first, we will close the issue.

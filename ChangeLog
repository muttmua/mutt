        * Make sure username is included in header and body cache paths.
        
        Commit 960afab4 changed URL generation to preserve the data originally
        in the mailbox URL, to fix some internal comparison problems.
        
        Unfortunately, it also affected header and body cache generation.
        Since those could easily be shared across multi-muttrc situations,
        it's important the username be part of the pathname.
        
        Thanks to exg on the #mutt IRC channel for reporting the regression!

        * Fix mutt_paddstr() to properly filter unprintable chars.
        
        The original version of this function had no "replacement character"
        functionality, so it simply directly called addnstr() to display the
        characters if everything was okay.
        
        Commit a080fd35 added replacement logic, similar to
        mutt_format_string(), but forgot to change addnstr to use the
        replacement character.
        
        This means garbage characters could goof up the mutt display, for
        things such as the subject in the compose menu.
        
        We could add calls to wcrtomb() like in mutt_format_string(), but
        mutt_addwch() already does this, and properly calls wcrtomb() a second
        time to add a shift sequence if needed.

        The code was previously reusing mutt_matches_ignore(), but that allows
        prefixes.  For mailto accepted headers we should be more picky.

        * Clarify description of $local_date_header
        
        When I reexamined the documentation of the $local_date_header option, I
        wasn't very confident about what it actually does. Much of what I did
        get from it came from a vague recollection of the discussion around when
        it was added, and I referred back to the commit which added this to
        solidify that understanding.
        
        Viewing this as a user (without looking at the internal implementation),
        I don't think the date is being converted, to me that implies that it
        was received from somewhere else in some other format; rather I'd view
        it as being initially generated in the local timezone.
        
        The reference to the "sender's timezone" makes me think that this would
        be operating on dates in messages received from other people; I've
        changed that to "your" to help clarify that it's about messages created
        locally.
        
        Finally, add information about what is done if this option is unset,
        along with some reasoning on why someone might want to unset this.

        * Don't queue IMAP close commands.
        
        Commit e7df4d5a changed the close commands to queue up, on the theory
        that it will always be followed by a SELECT or a LOGOUT.
        
        However, performing a <recall-message> while in the inbox will open a
        *new* connection.  mutt_conn_find() prepends the new conection to the
        Connections list.  The next mailbox opened will use that *new*
        connection.
        
        The effect will be the queued CLOSE won't occur before that mailbox is
        opened, and so "\Deleted" messages won't be expunged on the server
        right away.
        
        If the user had $move set and reopened their $spoolfile, they would
        find the read messages marked for delete but not yet expunged from the
        server.

        * Fix argc==0 handling.
        
        At least on Debian Linux, after invoking getopt() with argc==0, optind
        seems to remain at the default value of 1.
        
        mutt_dotlock was checking for optind==argc to report a missing
        parameter, and would end up invoking the function with the first
        environment variable instead.
        
        mutt, pgpewrap, and mutt_pgpring were assuming argv[0] was non-null,
        so just add a check and hardcode the value in that case to avoid a
        possible segv.
        
        mutt_pgpring allows no arguments.  Its parameters to
        pgpring_find_candidates() would pass the environment list and a
        negative nhints in that case.  The code seem to handle the case, but
        set optind=argc to be clear about it.

        * Add very basic cd path completion.
        
        This uses existing code to partially complete, and then launch the
        browser for selection.
        
        Unfortunately, completing a path argument brings up other issues, such
        as quoting, which this currently doesn't handle.  It also might be
        better to rotate through completions rather than launching the file
        brower.
        
        Add a "select directory" mode to the browser, modeled on the IMAP
        "enter vs select a mailbox with children" behavior: using <view-file>
        to select the directory and <select-entry> to enter the directory.

        * Add memcpy on MUTT_CMD completion to invoke the file selector.
        
        It looks like commit 844a133f (21 years ago) accidentally removed the
        memcpy while refactoring, but without it the mutt_select_file() won't
        be called on the second tab keypress.

        * Enable $rfc2047_parameters by default.
        
        20+ years later, Mutt still gets bug reports about attachment names in
        2047 encoded form.
        
        Although there is a tiny chance an attachment could legimately want to
        be named like that, it's far far more likely the sending MUA has
        incorrectly encoded the value.
        
        When a user has this problem, the "solution" is also difficult to
        find, unless they are initimately familiar with RFC2047 vs 2231.  So I
        think users would benefit much more from this being set by default.

        * Set environ for sendmail execvp() call.
        
        The code previously tried to use execvpe(), but that's a glibc
        extension.  However, it's not hard to manually set environ before an
        execvp() call to accomplish the same thing.

        Use the smtp_get_auth_response() added for gsasl, to allow
        multi-response lines and arbitrary length server response lines.  The
        rfc notes that SASL lines are not constrained by the SMTP line length
        limits.

        and base64 conversion to use buffers too.

        This will allow translators to add additional reply prefixes common to
        their locale.
        
        Add more documentation to the option, to explain the parts of the
        regular expression.  Give an example of adding more prefixes.
        
        Note that the result of this is stored in the header cache.  Probably
        people rarely were affected by this before, but with the new
        localization, people may experiment and need to be aware to turn the
        header cache off while testing.

        * Fix $reply_regexp default value.
        
        The default value happened to work, but didn't make logical sense.  It
        was using a bracket expression that *included* a backslash, and
        left-bracket, 0-9, and again a backslash.  The first ']' closed the
        bracket expression, and then '+' matched that 1 or more times,
        followed by ']'.  Fortunately the whole parenthisized expression had a
        '*' so it would repeat matching, but as far as I can tell, it was
        working accidentally.
        
        Because even the fixed version is hard to understand, add some
        explanation of the parts to the documentation.

        * Add GNU SASL support for authentication.
        
        It turns out Cyrus SASL's license may not be compatible with GPL
        programs, see Debian Bug 999672.
        
        So, add support for the GNU SASL library, using configure option
        --with-gsasl.
        
        I haven't touched the Cyrus SASL code in Mutt all that much in the
        past, but I've done my best to keep the gsasl code clean and simple.
        There are likely mistakes to be fixed and additions to be made,
        though.
        
        I queried the gsasl mailing list about the need for a socket
        wrapper (as is done for the cyrus code), and it seems this should no
        longer be needed.  As long as GSASL_QOP is left at the
        default (qop-auth), the client should ask for authentication, and not
        negotiate integrity or confidentiality.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock and
        Simon Josefsson for their reponses - although the blame is fully
        on *me* if this turns out to be incorrect).  Therefore there is no
        CONNECTION wrapping in this implementation.
        
        Add multiline response support for SMTP authentication (which is
        probably not actually needed).  Also add arbitrary line length for the
        SASL server responses (the RFCs note that for SASL, the protocol line
        lengths don't apply).

        Add a context counter for the trash status flag.  Compare that to the
        number of deleted messages to determine modified state.
        
        Note that "undeleting" a trashed message will set context->changed.
        Without that we couldn't do a simple counter comparison.  But with
        context->changed checked first, we can assume equal trash and deleted
        flags then means there are no "delete" modifications pending.

        When closing a mailbox, the $delete quadoption is not consulted to

        * Convert COLOR_DEFAULT constant to -1.
        
        Previously, "mono" assigned -1 to fg/bg to indicate "unset" values.
        
        NCurses uses -1 to indicate "default" color (when supported), but
        COLOR_DEFAULT was assigned the value -2 and swapped at the last
        moment.  While it worked, I personally found this confusing.
        
        To make the logic clearer, create a COLOR_UNSET constant with value
        -2, and switch COLOR_DEFAULT to -1.  Then remove the last-minute
        translation when allocating the color.
        
        Change the "not set" initialization and testing to use COLOR_UNSET for
        clarity.
        
        Because map_getvaluebyname() returns -1 for a missing value,
        create a new lookup function that returns the matching mapping_t or
        NULL if not found.

        * Fix color object case insensitive comparisons.
        
        In most of the color code, mutt_getvaluebyname() is used to compare
        against valid tables, which is (ascii) case insensitive.
        
        However, 'uncolor' and 'color quoted' for some reason used case
        sensitive comparison.
        
        The uncolor code can use object comparison instead, as the matching
        Fields value was just retrieve.  For 'color quoted', switch to using
        ascii_strncasecmp() instead.

        * Improve pattern compiler whitespace skipping.
        
        Commit 564b515c fixed a problem with nested patterns, where trailing
        whitespace could cause a compilation error.  That fix added missing
        SKIPWS() calls in a couple branches.
        
        However, the real problem is that the loop doesn't ensure whitespace
        is skipped *before* checking for *ps.dptr.
        
        Rather than relying on all the case branches (and "eater" functions)
        to skip the whitespace after processing, rearrange the logic so the
        SKIPWS() is after the switch statement.

        IMAP cleans this up already (and file-based mailboxes don't allow it).
        
        It's easy to have this happen by tab-completing a maildir mailbox at
        the change folder prompt.  Removing the slash makes the display more
        uniform, and prevents some problems such as $trash folder comparison.

        * Add $attach_save_charset_convert quadoption.
        
        This prompts to allow charset conversion of received text-type
        attachments.
        
        Mutt automatically converts when sending to a value from
        $send_charset.  If an attachment were automatically converted from
        utf-8 to iso-8859-1 on the sending side, then on the receiving
        side (also 99.9% likely to be utf-8 nowadays) it may not be helpful to
        save the the originally utf-8 attachment as iso-8859-1.  This can be
        especially destructive for attached patches or translation updates.
        
        Add the quadoption, defaulting to ask-yes so people know about it.
        With a quadoption, it can be easily completely turned off or made the
        default if the user desires.
        
        Add code to skip the prompt if converting from ascii to extended
        ascii (e.g. utf-8 or iso-8859-*).  There may be others too but this
        should cover almost all cases nowadays.

        mutt_decode_attachment() does not change offset, length, or type.  The

        The save/restore appears to be copy/pasted from other code.  The
        length/type are assigned to if the BODY is passed to a helper function
        after the decode, but that's not the case here.  Remove the

        The smime_invoke_verify() call uses the signedfile directly, not the

        * Implement <select-entry> as <display-message> in index menu.
        
        The default keybindings of <display-message> overshadow those of
        <select-entry>.  However, for someone who rebinds (globally or just in
        the index menu), it's still possible to invoke <select-entry> inside
        the index.
        
        It's debatable if <display-message> is the only choice in this case.
        For instance, <attach-message> in the compose menu could conceivably
        make use of the function.  However that opens another set of issues,
        and as someone on mutt-users said is solving a problem no one has
        complained about.
        
        For now, I think <display-message> is the best choice outside of
        displaying an error message, so make it do that.

        Without this, IMAP autoreconnect, background-edit Fcc, browser

        Change imap_qualify_path() to preserve the password if it is present
        in IMAP_MBOX for the generated URL.
        
        In almost all cases, DT_PATH types are run through
        mutt_pretty_mailbox(), which filters out the passwords, before
        displaying them in the UI.
        
        However there are a few cases where the context->path is displayed
        directly.  Create a new function, mutt_buffer_remove_path_password()
        to remove it and display that instead.

        With the default keymap, hitting 'D' in the compose menu will remove
        parts and unlink owned files.  Mutt prevents removing all the parts,
        but if you have added attachments, this makes it very easy mis-type
        and accidentally nuke the message you've been composing.
        
        This option only checks for the first part - which is highly likely
        the main composed message.  It might be possible to try and make the
        check more intelligent, but I think a simple check will go a long way

        * Use cms utility for SMIME encryption/decryption.
        
        The openssl smime utility only supports RSA keys for encryption (more
        specifically, the PKCS7 container that it uses can't be used with other
        key types).  The cms utility supports newer versions of the SMIME RFCs,
        including the use DH ephemeral-static algorithms for encrypting the
        symmetric key used during message encryption.
        
        This patch updates the suggested encryption/decryption commands, but
        does not change any of the commands used for signature
        generation/verification (as the smime sign/verify commands do support
        other key types).
        
        Debian seems to have already made this change[1] for the decryption path
        a while ago, but did not update the encryption command (current Debian
        patch for this file[2]).  There is a slight danger of updating the
        decryption command at the same time as the encryption command (as
        clients still trying to decrypt with smime could have problems reading
        messages encrypted with cms), but the existence of that Debian bug seems
        to imply that there is already a source of messages using the newer CMS
        format.
        
        I verified that I am now able to encrypt a message with public key type
        id-ecPublicKey.  Previously, this resulted in an error like:
        "encryption not supported for this key type:pk7_lib.c"

        * Improve conststrings.c generation, mainly for GNU Autoconf 2.71.
        
        With GNU Autoconf 2.71, the "ac_cs_config=" line in config.status may
        contain sequences like '\'' when a configure argument has spaces in it,
        for instance CFLAGS with several options. Thus it is not sufficient to

        GNU Autoconf 2.69 was including the whole $ac_cs_config value inside
        double quotes, and the previous code also had issues with configure
        arguments containing special characters (but spaces were fine).

        * Lazily update header colors after a thread-flag update.
        
        Although there are other issues with threads and ~() color patterns,
        this helps with collapsed thread coloring.  The thread-flag update can
        change the matching pattern, but that should be determined after all
        the thread messages are changed.
        
        For example, a collapsed thread with deleted messages and a color
        pattern '~v ~(~D)' should display differently after <undelete-thread>.
        Changing it to update colors lazily allows correct coloring (for that
        case).

        * Add $sort_thread_groups for top-level thread sorting.
        
        closes #368.
        
        Rename THREAD->sort_key to sort_aux_key, to make the fields more
        distinct.  Add THREAD->sort_group_key for caching the top-level sort
        HEADER.  An additional value is needed to allow propagating up values,
        for place-holder threads, and for "last" sort handling.
        
        Add recalc_aux_key and recalc_group_key bits to THREAD, in addition to
        sort_children.  These are used to allow separate flagging of either
        the group key or aux key needing to be recalculated.  Adding these two
        fields helped me keep better track of how the subthread sorting was
        working, because I'm just not as smart the people who originally wrote
        the threading code.  :-)
        
        Fix up some of the logic with rescoring, and "first_message" to take
        the new config vars into account.
        
        Add %T expando to $status_format, and change the default to
        conditionally show the value based on whether $sort is "threads" and
        $sort_thread_groups is not "aux".
        
        Lastly, a thank you to Eric Blake.  He implemented separate
        thread/subthread sorting in the NeoMutt code, after suggesting it on
        the #mutt IRC channel a couple months ago.  When ticket 368 was opened
        he pointed me at his work and offered to port.  However, I couldn't
        pass up the opportunity to learn more about the thread code myself, so
        I declined his offer.
        
        Although no copy/pasting was done, the basic of structure of the
        mutt_sort_subthreads() changes is the same, and I did look at his
        modifications to the function for guidance.  Thank you Eric!

        * Make index sort compare functions independent from config variables.
        
        Previously, the various compare functions used the macros AUXSORT and
        SORTCODE internally.  Those macros performed auxilliary sort using the
        AuxSort global, and also directly referenced SortAux and Sort to
        determine whether to reverse the result.
        
        This made the compare functions inflexible to handle other uses, such
        as $sort_thread_groups, which will be introduced in the next commit.
        
        Instead, introduce helper functions in sort.c and thread.c that call
        the compare functions, and have their own logic for auxilliary sort
        and reverse.
        
        Remove the no longer needed Sort=SortAux assignment around thread
        sorting, and change mutt_sort_subthreads() to reference SortAux
        instead.

        Some of the menus are directly of MENU_GENERIC type.  In a few places,

        Remove double "generic" lookups when Mutt is in a generic menu.
        
        Fix the help menu to not show unbound or "generic bindings" for a
        generic menu.
        
        For exec completion, always add generic functions to the possible
        completion list.

        Move the "extra" keybindings added manually inside km_init() into the
        keybinding tables instead.
        
        This allows the documentation in the manual to be generated correctly.
        
        It also corrects a small problem with duplicate OPS in the struct
        binding_t table.  The exec completion and unbound list in the help
        menu iterated the active binding_t table and assumed each OP appears
        only once.  When '\n' and '\r' were both added to the binding_t table,
        this broke the assumption and caused those to misbehave.

        * Enable nonl() mode for ncurses.  closes #362.
        
        This patch is based on the patch from Mike Frysinger, archived from
        the old trac system at:
        https://gitlab.com/muttmua/trac-tickets/-/blob/master/attachments/3494/mutt-enter-return-hg-6658.patch
        
        This version creates a new key symbol, <KeypadEnter> for the KEY_ENTER
        value returned by getch().  According to Vincent Lefèvre's research,
        that corresponds to the "key pad" Enter key.  If KEY_ENTER is not
        defined, it binds the symbol to "\n".  It does this after the
        KeyNames[] definitions of <Enter> and <Return> so they remain the
        default shown by <what-key>.
        
        Since Mutt already accepts KEY_ENTER at the y/n prompt, add it for all
        the built-in operations too.
        
        Bindings with "\r" and "\n" in the binding_t structures don't need
        "<enter>" and "<return>" to be re-specified in km_init(), so remove
        those.  Instead add the "<KeypadEnter>" bindings there.
        
        Remove unnecessary Alias menu bindings for OP_GENERIC_SELECT_ENTRY in
        km_init().
        
        As a note: I don't believe non-extended key symbol bindings need to be
        bound inside km_init().  I'm not clear why this was done, or what
        purpose it serves.  I'll do a bit more research, but if I can't
        uncover any issues, will move them inside the binding_t structures in
        another commit.

        Thanks to Ian Collier for making this suggestion!
        
        It's more efficient and disables unhelpful compiler warnings about
        strncpy(), since strfcpy is terminating the string itself.
        
        If memccpy() is unavailable, use strncpy() but keep the old behavior
        of strncpy() length C instead of C-1, as I believe it tickles less
        compiler warnings.

        * Silence strfcpy() warning in dotlock_deference_symlink().
        
        The compiler is being a bit strange, only picking out and warning
        about the 'strfcpy (d, pathptr, l);' line at the bottom of the
        function, even though the source and dest are the same size.
        
        It seems a shame to leave just this last one, since all the other
        warnings (at least on Debian) have been vanquished.
        
        So, to calm the compiler down, "russian doll" the buffer size down the
        call stack "dotlock_dispatch() -> dotlock_prepare() ->
        dotlock_deference_symlink()".

        We don't want to abort, because that would change long-standing

        expected.
        
        However, to make a potential unexpected problem easier to debug, add a
        dprint.

        * Use memcpy in fseek_last_message() instead of strncpy.
        
        We are copying raw bytes and don't care about embedded nuls, so
        eliminate a compiler warning by using memcpy.  BUFSIZ is guaranteed to
        be at least 256.
        
        Adjust the weird BUFSIZ + 9 size, which was added by an old commit
        86f376dc that appears to have been a dead end.  Also remove the no
        longer relevant comment next to the strncpy.
        
        Although it may be "safer" to use strlen() for the mutt_strncmp()
        parameter, the code is performing this comparison over and over.  We
        already hardcode 7 in the buffer size and memcpy.  So, make this loop

        * Fix usage and version write error checking.
        
        "fflush (stdout)" is needed to detect most errors (only a closed stdout
        could be detected otherwise). A ferror test is also needed to avoid
        false positives since the C standard allows errno to be set even in
        the absence of errors.

        * Add usage and version write error checking.
        
        'mutt -v' and 'mutt -h' did not check to ensure output actually
        printed to stdout.
        
        Technically, this is a lazy check, because many things can set errno,
        and it only checks errno at the end, rather than the return value of
        each write call.  I'm compromising correctness for code readability in
        this case, given these are just help and version output commands.

        * Reset SIGPIPE signal handler in child process before exec().
        
        Ignored signals, such as SIGPIPE in Mutt, are inherited by child
        processes.  This can cause incorrect behavior in filter-like programs
        that expect SIGPIPE to be the default value of "Term".
        
        A couple other places in Mutt already reset SIGTERM, SIGTSTP, and
        SIGCONT, with a comment mentioning it really wasn't necessary.  Since
        I don't much like messing with signals, I'll leave those resets in.
        
        Extract those plus SIGPIPE into a new function,
        mutt_reset_child_signals() and add that before each exec call.
        
        Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for reporting the issue and for the initial

        * Directly add full mailbox to GPG search hints.
        
        The code previously called (crypt/pgp)_add_string_to_hints(), which
        performs a strtok() using " ,.:\"()<>\n" and discards parts of size 3
        or less.
        
        This makes sense for personal fields, and random "stuff" entered in
        the getkeybystr() prompt.  But it doesn't make a lot of sense for the
        mailbox.
        
        There's no advantage I can see in chopping off and discarding the
        domain name for getting more relevant results.
        
        Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother fixing this, but in ticket 354 someone
        is experimenting with alternative backends, and they would like the
        full email address listed in the hints.

        * Include <term.h> before invoking tigetstr() and tigetflag().
        
        On NetBSD, a segv was occurring in mutt_ts_capability() because
        tigetstr() was implicitly declared and thus defaulted to return type
        int.  The 8-byte (char *) actually returned was being converted to a
        4-byte int before being assigned to the (char *) variable.  This
        resulted in a corrupted pointer, causing a segv when dereferenced.
        
        I thought C99+ should warn about implicit declarations.  Although
        configure.ac AC_PROG_CC_C99 asserts the compiler can handle C99,
        perhaps it doesn't put the compiler in the mode to strictly enforce
        it.  (Thanks to rkta on IRC for the input).
        
        The solution, as the man page notes, is to include <term.h> before
        invoking those functions.
        
        Unfortunately term.h pollutes the namespace with all sorts of defines.
        Currently that include columns and lines, which are used inside Mutt.
        
        To help prevent issues, create Mutt wrappers for the functions and
        split them into a separate file, curs_ti_lib.c, that #include
        <term.h>, rather than just adding #include <term.h> to mutt_curses.h
        
        Apparently on some older platforms, #include <curses.h> would also
        include term.h, so make sure columns in undef'ed in mutt_curses.h.  (I
        think we would have heard about that problem already, but just in
        case.)
        
        A huge thank you to rahl on IRC for debugging this issue, and working
        with me over IRC to test various suggestions until the issue was
        found.  I didn't have access to a NetBSD instance, so rahl saved me
        much time and effort, and was crucial to fixing this bug.

        * Fix mutt_ts_capability() fallback list loop.
        
        The for loop termination check should be '*termp', not 'termp'.  termp
        starts as &known[0], so to check for the NULL terminator, we need to
        look at *termp.
        
        Since *termp is now checked in each loop, it no longer needs to be in
        the if check inside the loop, so remove it there.
        
        This hasn't been blowing up because the mutt_strncasecmp() check
        inside the loop was also incorrect.  It should be scanning for a
        matching entry, but was looking for non-zero (nonmatching) retval.
        Since term can't match both the first and second entries, it would
        always return 1 and would never get to the loop NULL terminator.

        * Fix SMTP response text potential buffer overread.
        
        mutt_socket_readln() returns the number of bytes, including the '\0'.
        smtp_code() only verifies 4 bytes (or a minimum strlen() of 3).
        
        The smtp_get_resp() and smtp_auth_sasl() were both looking at "buf+4"
        without verifying the string went past "buf+3".
        
        Note RFC 4954 and 5321 say there should be a trailing space on a
        response code with no text.  But if the server neglected that, buf+4
        would try to read or decode past the read data.

        Mutt tries to hide the format=flowed stuff/unstuff processing from the

        instance).  It should also do this when piping the content to the

        * Don't force SMTP authentication without a username or client cert.
        
        See Debian bug 1001013.  This is a regression from commit 191b0513,
        which fixed SMTP client certification authentication (see GitLab
        ticket 336).  However, that commit assumed the server wouldn't
        advertise AUTH if it wasn't needed, which the Debian ticket shows is
        not always the case.
        
        Client certificate support still relies on AUTH properly being set.
        
        Add a check for either the username or a cert before calling
        smtp_auth().  The username check was removed by the above mentioned
        commit, but more importantly the username is no longer set by the
        OpenSSL/GnuTLS client cert code.  (Which was the main problem
        addressed by the commit).  So there shouldn't be an issue with adding
        the username check back.

        * Loosen imap_open_mailbox() SELECT response data parsing.
        
        DavMail is putting more than one space between '*' and the EXISTS
        count, e.g. '*  5 EXISTS'
        
        Strictly speaking, this is disallowed by RFC3501 (see Section 9, Note
        2).  However, there is also no good reason for imap_open_mailbox() to
        be stricter than the untagged handler, which correctly extracts the
        count.
        
        Add a check to make sure we are looking at an untagged response, and

        * QRESYNC: don't increment msn for missing headers.
        
        Commit 74ce032f moved the msn increment outside the check for a
        missing header.  The idea was that a header-cache hole needed to be
        accounted for.  However, a header can also be missing just by a VANISH
        happening the last time the mailbox was open.
        
        Since the header won't be in the uid_hash, cmd_parse_vanished() can't
        decrement subsequent msns, so it need to be done in this loop.
        
        If there is a header cache hole, or another problem, verify_qresync()
        will detect a problem and try again without QRESYNC.
        
        However if there were an actual stored "blank", do increment, since
        there was no UID to process a vanish on.

        The function was pulled from the other sort methods used in mutt.  But

        difference between two UID values is greater than a signed int can
        represent, it will sort improperly.

        * Preserve QRESYNC seqset holes when restoring from header cache.
        
        It's possible for there to be holes in the MSN sequence, and also in
        the header cache.  When iterating through the seqset, preserve those
        by incrementing msn even if the result isn't found in the header
        cache (because it is 0 or because the record is missing in the header
        cache).

        * Don't include inactive messages in msgset generation.
        
        Currently only deleted messages that will be expunged are marked
        inactive, so it shouldn't be an issue.  However, before the previous
        commit (changing sorting by UID), I think there was a possibility for
        a bug if trailing expunge-marked messages with MAXINT index were also
        marked inactive.
        
        The sort change fixes that, but to make the code clearer just remove
        the possibility of inactive messages being included.

        * Sort headers by UID when generating a msgset sequence.
        
        When there is a hole in the header cache, the UID numbers are no
        longer guaranteed to increase with the index.  This can result in
        incorrect msgset values being sent to the server.

        * Add a hard redraw after oauth authentication.
        
        The sample contrib program can use gpg to decrypt a token.  This may
        pop up a curses agent prompt, requiring a hard redraw.
        
        It may be that we should be calling a hard redraw after any fork/exec.
        I don't know if this will cause more problems, so for now I'll just
        patch this one place.  But that is something to consider.

        * listmenu: Fix parsing of list headers for mbox
        
        The parsing of the headers needs to skip the "From " lines at the start
        of the messages in mbox format. This now uses the same logic like
        mutt_read_rfc822_header in parse.c.

        * Fix menu.c sigwinch handling order.
        
        This fixes problems with a sigwinch that occurs during an external
        process, such as during a query menu lookup, or after exiting the
        background-edit landing page.  Without this change, the user would see
        a misdrawn screen and would need to press a key first.
        
        Change it so that the SigWinch flag is handled before reading input,
        so that the page is automatically redrawn.  This matches the behavior
        in the index, pager, and background-edit process list menu.

        * Do not set From reverse name on postponed or to be resend messages
        
        Messages to be resend or resumed from postponed already had
        reverse names and alternates evaluated the first time they entered
        the compose menu and send-hook were already executed then. The
        user may also had edited the From to any other content before
        postponing or sending the message. Upon resuming, do not overwrite
        with a reverse_name lookup and do not remove the real name if
        reverse_realname=no is set.

        * fix gcc-11 build warnings for H_TO_INTL()
        
        The macro H_TO_INTL() in mutt_idna.c, causes a lot of build warnings
        about the indentation of the if () line to try to warn the developer
        that it looks like this might be a bug:
        
        mutt_idna.c: In function ‘mutt_env_to_intl’:
        mutt_idna.c:327:5: warning: this ‘if’ clause does not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]

        This goes on for many lines.
        
        Fix this up by properly indenting the lines so that gcc "knows" we mean
        well here.

        * Trim the ToC for the option list in the manual
        
        Currently, every variable is shown in the table of contents of the
        reference manual. Variable list is over 400 items long. This makes the
        ToC difficult to work with.
        
        Removing is done by adding an overwriting template for the parent of
        variables section (that is sect1 tag with id="variables"). In the
        DocBook source matching template calls another template named subtoc
        with two parameters: context (self element) and nodes (child
        sections). Normally a list of descendant nodes is passed here, but we
        don't want that and instead call subtoc with no parameters.
        
        This approach results in semantically correct code being generated in
        all modes.
        
        Note, that the ID (variables) will have to be kept in sync with XML
        generating code, but that is already hardcoded elsewhere.

        Add an option to convert the date used in the Date header into the local

        header to be formatted using the GMT timezone.

        * Add sanitize call in print mailcap function.
        
        The mutt_rfc1524_expand_filename() function calls mutt_adv_mktemp(),
        which also calls the sanitizer.
        
        However, if the recv-mode suggested filename has a slash, it's better
        to sanitize before calling expand_filename() too, to preserve the
        entire filename (albeit with the slashes sanitized out).
        
        For example (ignoring name templates) if the file were called
        "either/or.pdf", pre-sanitizing would generate "either_or.pdf", while
        not doing so would generate "or.pdf".

        This will allow "view" mailcap invocations and autoview invocations to
        display something reasonable for international file names.  Also add
        the flag to mutt_adv_mktemp(), which the mailcap viewer calls.
        
        Convert the 'slash parameter' to an ALLOW_SLASH flag.  This makes the
        flags consistent (both "allow" something not permitted by default),
        and invocations more readable.

        The value-to-name mapping uses the first match.  Grouping by value

        * Disable markers when wrap is at column 1.
        
        This can occur when the user resizes the window to a single column, or
        if they 'set wrap=1'.
        
        In that case, Mutt was outputting the '+' and setting the initial
        output to the second column.  However, if there is only one column,
        nothing would then be printed.  When trying to search or jump to end,
        Mutt would enter an infinite loop because no forward progress would be
        made in the file with each line.
        
        Disable the markers if there is only a single column, so at least one
        character of the message will get printed on each line.

        * Improve body_pattern and quoting when skipping down.
        
        The previous commit added the MUTT_TYPES flag to the search operation.
        However, adding the flag caused body_pattern and classify_quote
        matching to occur, as part of searching.
        
        Separate those two to only be done when MUTT_SHOWCOLOR is passed.  Keep
        the classify_quote() call in resolve_types(), since otherwise during a
        normal display we would end up matching the regexps twice.
        
        Add a flag so the computation only occurs once, instead of each time
        the line is shown.
        
        For continuation lines, we need to scan from the start of line.
        Otherwise body_patterns and proper quote level coloring won't appear
        if we jump down to the middle of a continuation line.
        
        As part of this commit, I noticed is_cont_hdr was not reset when
        handling a REDRAW_FLOW.  I believe this also fixes the old trac ticket
        issue 3744.

        * Add MUTT_TYPES flag for pager search operation.
        
        This allows the display_line() search scanner to also determine the
        type of each line.  Without that, searching down would not be able to
        properly highlight header lines or quote lines.

        * Fix ansi colors to use default bg/fg when not set.
        
        Note the ColorList stores COLOR_DEFAULT (-2) not -1, so we need to
        translate those values in mutt_alloc_ansi_color().  If the curses
        backend doesn't support default colors, we abort and just return color
        pair 0.

        * Use bkgrndset() as ATTRSET() backend if available.
        
        This function allows more usable color pairs, because it passes the
        pair parameter separately.  The COLOR_PAIR() macro only returns 8-bits
        for a pair, limiting the total pairs used to 256 despite many systems
        having much larger COLOR_PAIRS values.
        
        In order to do this, separate out the pair and attrs values, instead
        of combining attr + COLOR_PAIR(pair) into a single value and storing
        that inside Mutt.  For the older calls, bkgdset() and attrset(), we
        call COLOR_PAIR() at the last minute.
        
        Add COLOR_ATTR to header cache sum calculation, since it is used in
        the HEADER now.

        Allow, for example, a ~B against a huge mailbox to be interruped via

        mutt_search_command() - not prompting and just interrupting.  We could
        add a prompt if it's really deemed necessary, but I think if they hit
        ctrl-c they want to stop the pattern operation now.
        
        Since it's not practical to roll back, leave the Context in the "in

        message cache user should not notice any change.

        * Minor fixes to match_body_patterns().
        
        Change the end condition to compare against buflen.  I prefer this
        because we are not directly incrementing offset ourselves, but relying
        on the rational return values from regexec.  If the regex library
        (incorrectly) returned a nul-match at the '\0' terminator for
        instance, the new nul-match logic would assign offset just past the
        terminator.
        
        Remove the i=0 initialization during definition, because it doesn't
        use or need it.

        * Factor out match_body_patterns to make resolve_types() simpler.
        
        The body pattern matching part has been getting more complex, and is
        now too big to have its details sit amongst the resolve_types()
        logic.  Factor it out into a separate procedure.

        * Fix body color null_rx handling.
        
        The existing code did not work properly.  If the null_rx occurred
        before another matching entry in the list, it would be ignored.  If it
        occurred afterward, it could cause the entries to be created
        out-of-order which would affect the binary search later on when
        rendering.
        
        Instead, use the normal "match assignment" code, but if the best
        result is a null_rx match, simply discard it and increment the offset
        past the end of the null match.

        * Improve body color matching speed by caching future matches.
        
        On a *very* long body (or header_partial) lines with multiple color
        lines that match, performance can be degraded.  For instance if there
        were moderately expensive regexp matches against "A" "B" and "C".  A
        line with:
        
          A A A A A B A A C A A A B A A A C
        
        The B and C regexps were scanned again after every "A" match, despite
        that the result would be discarded again for the next A match.
        
        Change the color matching to cache the location of each color line
        match.  Discard the cache once the match offset passes that point.

        * Fix $ssl_client_cert usage with SMTP.
        
        The ssl and gnutls client-cert setup code was calling
        mutt_account_getuser().  This caused two problems.  First, it's not
        necessarily the case that there will be a username.  Second,
        populating the user would cause smtp_open() to check for AUTH
        capabilities and call smtp_auth - even if the user is already
        authenticated by the cert.  The server won't advertize AUTH if they
        already authenticated, causing a connection abort.
        
        Remove prompt for mutt_account_getuser() in the ssl and gnutls client
        certificate connection code.  The SASL code has callbacks, so I don't
        understand why it would need this.  Let's take it out and see if
        anyone screams 8-P.  If necessary, we can add a mutt_account_getuser()
        call to the very beginning of imap_auth_sasl().
        
        Revamp the openssl ssl_passwd_cb() prompt.  From the man pages, it
        appears to be used for the cert decryption.  There's no need to call
        mutt_account_getuser() and use the generic mutt_account_getpass() just
        to read a password in.  Instead create a callback function version to
        customize the prompt for a client cert with just the host.
        
        Change the SMTP authentication test to check if the AUTH capabilities
        are set, instead of if the user field is set before calling
        smtp_auth().

        * Prompt for retry on decrypt failure for mime message attachments.
        
        Closes #331.
        
        Change $forward_decyrpt to a quadoption, defaulting 'yes' for backward
        compatibility.  This will allow users to choose on a per-message
        attachment basis if desired.
        
        If decoding from $mime_forward_decode fails or decrypting from
        $forward_decrypt, notify the user and prompt to retry attaching
        without the decode/decrypt.
        
        $forward_decrypt directly invokes decryption and returns -1 on error,
        while $mime_forward_decode uses the handler rendering, which returns a
        non-fatal 1 (to allow message display of failing encrypted message).
        So prompt on either case.
        
        If they decline to retry, or the retry fails, return NULL only on a
        hard-fail (-1) return code.  They've been warned and can peek at the
        final result.
        
        The send generate_body() code was not checking for a NULL result.
        This seems like a bad idea, so add a check and error message in that
        case.

        * Scan OPS files directly for gettext translation strings.
        
        Previously, gettext's po/Makefile.in.in was modified to separately
        scan and merge a generated file: keymap_alldefs.h.  Gettext doesn't
        recommend nor provide support for scanning generated files.
        
        However, there is no reason we have to scan the generated file.

        * Fix gettext update problems.
        
        The keymap_alldefs.h file was previously generated and scanned inside
        po/Makefile.in.in as an additional POTFILES files build dependency and
        step.
        
        The file can't be scanned by just adding it to po/POTFILES.in because
        it's a generated file that will be in the build directory.  The next

        * Update gettext to version 0.21.
        
        Run 'gettextize -f --no-changelog' to update to 0.21.
        
        This removes the entire intl directory, and relies on an external
        libintl only.
        
        $(INTLLIBS) should now be referred to as $(LIBINTL), so change all
        references.
        
        Unfortunately, some of the gettext m4 files were modified and "mutt
        customized" in the past.  I'm trying to keep them in a pristine state
        after this upgrade.  glibc21.m4, lcmessage.m4, codeset.m4 have also
        been removed.
        
        Manually call AM_ICONV in configure.ac.  This was previously called
        in the modified "MUTT_AM_GNU_GETTEXT" but the result $am_cv_func_iconv
        is tested just below.
        
        locale.h is a standard library defined by C99.  The gpgme and pgp code
        wrapped those includes in HAVE_LOCALE_H checks, but that check was
        performed inside of gettext.m4.  Remove the check inside those
        files (locale.h is already included unconditionally elsewhere in
        Mutt).
        
        Copy the sample gettext.h file and include that instead, as suggested
        by the gettext documentation.
        
        unistd.h is also a standard posix header, so remove HAVE_UNISTD_H
        checks inside mutt too.
        
        Create po/LINGUAS file listing available languages.
        
        Create po/Makevars from the template and customize for Mutt.
        
        Set PO_DEPENDS_ON_POT to no to prevent po file rebuilds.  According to
        the gettext manual, with this set, "PO files can be accidentally
        updated even if a POT file is not updated" when using git.

        * Change attach inline forward messages default CH flag.
        
        Fix it to be CH_DECODE instead of CH_XMIT.
        
        I believe this was a mistake from a long time ago.  The CH_XMIT flag
        is used in mutt for:
        - mutt_save_message() -> set_copy_flags() when decoding
        - pre-send conversion to 7 bit
        - mutt_make_message_attach() (for index mime-forwarding)
        - message bouncing
        
        Using it for *inline* forwarding in the attachment menu doesn't make
        sense.  Both include_forward() in send.c, and include_header() in
        recvcmd.c use CH_DECODE.  It seems reasonable to decode headers when
        inline forwarding from the attachment menu (as is done from the
        index), so I'm guessing that was what was meant here too.

        * Filter ANSI sequences when forwarding too.
        
        Add a MUTT_CM_FORWARDING flag to correspond with the MUTT_CM_REPLYING
        flag.  Check those to turn on ANSI filtering.
        
        In order to guard against other accidental prefix setting without one
        of those flags, also check s->prefix to enable ANSI filtering (and
        prefix printing) too.
        
        Add missing MUTT_CM_REPLYING flags to the recvcmd.c reply functions.
        
        While updating the recvcmd.c reply code, I noticed CH_REORDER wasn't
        enabled with OPTWEED, like in the send.c code (and everywhere else),
        so add the missing flag.

        * Add explicit flag to check for postponed message on <mail>.
        
        This used to check for:
          !flags && !msg
        which was still relatively clear that it was a unique situation (just
        for <mail> in the index and pager).
        
        With the addition of background editing, it became:
          (sctx->flags == SENDBACKGROUNDEDIT) && !sctx->msg
        This is less intuitively understood to be just for the <mail> case,
        and thus perhaps easy to create a bug in the future.
        
        Create an explicit flag, SENDCHECKPOSTPONED to perform the check, and
        enable for the <mail> operation in the index and pager.

        Previously, Mutt would find the first match and use that.
        
        However, the example shown in the manual:
          hdr_order From Date: From: To: Cc: Subject:
        gives the expectation that an mbox From_ line would print first, then
        the Date:, and then the From: header.
        
        Change the matcher to scan all HeaderOrderList entries and use the
        longest match.
        
        Update the documentation to make it clear From_ lines are printed out
        with other "real" headers, and can be manipulated via ignore and
        hdr_order commands.

        * Fix double spacing after group display-name in pager and message.
        
        Edit-headers and message writing uses mutt_write_rfc822_header() ->
        mutt_write_address_list(), which renders each address one by one and
        outputs to a file.  rfc822_write_address_single() already appends a
        space after the group display-name colon delimiter.
        
        Rendering to the pager uses a different code path:
        address_header_decode() -> format_address_header().  The logic is very
        similar to mutt_write_address_list() except it renders to memory.  It
        also needs to avoid re-appending a space after the group display-name.

        Because pair "0" is reserved (and we start searching at index 1), we

        Also, don't increment UserColors during the check, because that would
        incorrectly inflate the number of color pairs allocated if none are
        available.  That would delay or even remove the ability to reallocate
        pairs after future color pair frees.
        
        It actually would make more sense to just check (index > COLOR_PAIRS -
        1).  But since UserColors is incremented here, and is used in dprint
        statements, keep the check consistent.

        * Move empty color slot finding into initial compare loop.
        
        There is no need to scan the list again to find the place for a new
        entry, since we already do to check for duplicates.
        
        Store the last pointer in the initial loop, and calculate the lowest
        available index at the same time.

        * Add code to free ansi colors.
        
        The 256 color ansi-escape sequence commit can create many more
        potential ansi colors than the 8-color version, so they shouldn't be
        allowed to just accumulate.
        
        Free ansi colors when exiting the pager.  The pager can be called
        nested, so this could prematurely free the colors, but they will be
        automatically reallocated.
        
        Ansi and overlay colors shouldn't be refcounted like normal colors, so
        add a bit field for both.
        
        For now, we just let overlay colors accumulate, as before.  If this
        becomes a problem, we could periodically flush them, the same way as
        ansi colors - perhaps when changing mailboxes.
        
        Change ColorList to be sorted by index.  This removes the O(n^2) loop
        just to find the next available index.
        
        Likewise, improve the mutt_free_color() loop to keep track of the last
        pointer instead of relooping.

        rkta on irc reported a build failure because the gss headers were not

        Abort configure if the library/header checks don't pass.  It would

        Turn all the backend options into '--with' options and add a dir

        backend, turning off scanning.  Specifying --without skips scanning
        for a backend.
        
        Update the INSTALL file to make that clear.  This actually wasn't even
        clear to me until I studied it now, and for years I've been using an
        obfuscated combination of --without and --with to specify the backend,

        * Correct length to use LOFF_T.
        
        This is a part two, made in master, to the stable branch commit
        11b18027.  These are mostly length adjustments to use LOFF_T, matching the
        BODY->length type.
        
        An argument could be made for size_t instead, and a few places in Mutt
        do assign between those types.  I've used LOFF_T because off_t is a
        signed integer.  Some changes in this commit affect loops that
        decrement a length pointer while > 0.  Switching to a size_t could
        create a wraparound infinite loop bug.
        
        This also changes the Content-Length header parser to use atoll()
        intead of atol().  I noticed from the man page that atol() doesn't
        seem to return -1 on error.  But I've kept the check anyway.

        As long as I'm touching the buffers, convert them to use the buffer

        never be NULL.  Prior to the "fix" in commit f420be68, this was not
        true, even if MoreArgs() returns true, because the argument could be
        just ''.
        
        The parse_keymap() change fixed a possible segv.  Don't use the buffer
        pool, because it returns buf->data to the caller.
        
        I don't believe the other two would segv, but they did still rely on
        the old behavior where the the buffer would have a '\0' appended
        always.  So, change them to use the buffer pool to be cleaner.

        * add dprintf(n, fmt, ...) debugging macro
        
        dprintf(n, fmt, ...) is a more natural form of
        dprint(n, (debugfile, fmt, ...)). It prints code location in the debug
        file where possible.
        
        I believe this approach, while common, was not previously used because
        we were trying to be C90-compatible.  C90 doesn't provide variadic
        macros.  Now we require C99, so it makes sense to add this pattern.

        start_debug() takes a boolean indicating whether to rotate debug

        The -d option allows a negative number. If negative, debug files

        Furthermore, it turned out mutt_pretty_mailbox() deals with '.' and

        If the seqset ended with a comma, the substr_end marker would be just

        * Fix resolve_types() newline removal and restoration.
        
        If the line had a '\n', the previous code would leave it off.  The
        "buf[nl] = '\n'" at the end of the function was overwriting the old
        nul character, but there was a new one where the original newline was.
        
        However, if there was not a '\n', the code was removing the nul string
        terminator, which could cause very bad things for searches, (which are
        the only things that use fmt after resolve_types).  Since this bug has
        been there for 12 years, I'm guessing the lines always contain a
        trailing '\n'.
        
        Now, there is a potential problem with behavior changes here...  This
        could have an effect on the QuoteRegexp or SearchRE matches.  It turns
        out SearchRE is compiled with REG_NEWLINE, but the other isn't.  Since
        QuoteRegexp is (typically) only looking at the start of a line, I'm
        going to take the risk of restoring the '\n'.

        * Fix (un)setenv to not return an error with unset env vars.
        
        The code was returning -1 in those cases.  This can cause hook
        processors, such as send2-hook, to sleep 1 second without an error
        message being set and displayed.  It also causes the hook processor to
        abort executing subsequent matching commands.
        
        -1 should be reserved for syntax errors.  For setenv querying, change
        the return value to 0.  For unsetenv, generate a message and also
        change the return value to 0.
        
        <enter-command> checks if err->data is set to determine whether to
        print anything, and the behavior is used in the 'set' commands, so
        this is established correct behavior.

        * Fix pattern compilation error for ~( !~>(~P) )
        
        The problem is a nested recursive call followed by trailing
        whitespace.  Other codepaths ensure trailng whitespaces are processed
        when processing the argument, but the parenthesis calls did not.
        
        This meant the outer loop while check:
          while (*ps.dptr)
          {
            SKIPWS (ps.dptr);
            switch (*ps.dptr)
            {
              /* process (~P), for instance */
            }
          }
        would return true for the trailing space(s), the SKIPWS would skip
        over them, and then switch would try to evaluate '\0'.
        
        I think a better solution would be to rearrange the calls like:
          SKIPWS (ps.dptr);
          while (*ps.dptr)
          {
            switch (*ps.dptr)
            {
            }
            SKIPWS(ps.dptr);
          }
        to ensure any trailing whitespace is removed.
        
        However, that's a bit risky for a stable branch commit.  So instead,
        just explicitly add the SKIPWS for the ~() thread ops and for the ()
        groupings after processing the inside expression.

        When there was a group address terminator with no previous

        mx.mbox (allocated by imap_parse_path) was not always freed before

        The sync_cmd and cmd buffers were also not always freed.  One case was

        As long as I'm touching the buffers, convert them to use the buffer
        pool.  I think the mutt_buffer_clear() at the beginning of the retry
        loop isn't necessary, but will keep it to make it clear any existing

        * Fix offset to use LOFF_T in a couple places.
        
        The BODY->hdr_offset was incorrectly of type long, which could result
        in corrupted >2gb mbox files in some circumstances.
        
        The uses in mh_rewrite_message() are not as serious, but they should
        still be of type LOFF_T.
        
        I found both of these fixes in a patch file,
        bug-676388-largefile.patch, in the openSUSE mutt src rpm.  It looks
        like Harald Koenig was the original author of a larger patch in that
        openSUSE ticket, which was reduced over time as fixes were made to
        Mutt.
        
        Note that patch file also incorrectly adjusted old_hdr_lines in mh.c.
        I've removed that part, as HEADER->lines is type int.
        
        Unfortunately, the BODY->hdr_offset type change will result in a
        header cache change (i.e. invalidation).  I'm not enthused about doing
        that during a stable release, but the change is important enough to

        * Fix pager dropped input on SigWinch flag handling.
        
        The code to process the SigWinch flag ocurred after, and would drop an
        input character when the flag was set outside of, km_dokey().  This
        could happen, for instance, when a pipe operation was invoked.

        * Ensure mutt_extract_token() never returns a NULL dest->data.
        
        Commit e5a32a61 removed a 'mutt_buffer_addch (dest, 0)' at the end of
        the function.  Most callers had been converted to use the buffer pool,
        and the call was strange since buffers self-terminate.
        
        However, this line covered up logic errors in some of the callers,
        which assumed the buffer->data could not be NULL afterwards.
        
        I will try to fix up callers with the logic errors in master.  This is
        to fix the problem in stable, and also ensure future callers don't
        make the same mistake.

        * Fix REPLY_TO environment variable handling.
        
        Commit 4e153adf changed this code to reuse the function buffer
        variable, but forgot to rewind the buffer for parsing in
        parse_my_hdr().
        
        Additionally commit e5a32a61 removed an extra "null termination"
        mutt_buffer_addch() at the end of mutt_extract_token().  This caused a
        NULL value to be passed to the strpbrk() in parse_my_hdr(), causing a
        segv.  Change to use a buffer pool token parameter instead.
        
        I actually think, like with the previous IMAP mailbox handling, this
        method of adding a my_hdr is dangerous.  I'll look into refactoring it
        in master instead.

        If the last address was also terminated by a comma (e.g: foo@local,
        bar@local,) the exact-address was incorrectly overwriting the recorded
        value.

        * Fix exact-address handling when addr->personal is set.
        
        The exact-address compile-time option takes an exact copy of an
        address when it is parsed, and prints that out when outputting the
        address.  The idea is to preserve older "user@host (Name)" syntax.
        
        Unfortunately, when code tries to "update" the personal/name field, it
        needs to clear the exact-address copy for it to have any effect.
        
        An object-oriented design encapsulating the setting would help prevent
        this problem.  It might be desirable to create a C function instead,
        but callers would have to remember it, and such a thing isn't common
        in the Mutt codebase.
        
        Another patch (I'm still debating applying) changes the address parser
        to discard the exact-address copy when it exactly matches the
        mailbox.  However, that still won't fix every case (and it makes the
        parser even more difficult to follow.)
        
        So this commit (to stable) takes the straightforward approach.
        
        It fixes bugs in:
        
        * Alias creation.  The "personal name" prompt was ignored.
        
        * Autocrypt initialization from address setting with $realname.
        
        * $pgp_getkeys_command handling.
        
        * Query menu results.
        
        * "unset $reverse_realname" handling.
        
        * $from handling of $realname.
        
        * Bounce Resent-From handling of $realname.

        * Ensure IMAP connection is closed after a connection error.
        
        During connection, if the server provided an illegal initial response,
        Mutt "bailed", but did not actually close the connection.  The calling
        code unfortunately relied on the connection status to decide to
        continue with authentication, instead of checking the "bail" return
        value.
        
        This could result in authentication credentials being sent over an
        unencrypted connection, without $ssl_force_tls being consulted.
        
        Fix this by strictly closing the connection on any invalid response
        during connection.  The fix is intentionally small, to ease
        backporting.  A better fix would include removing the 'err_close_conn'
        label, and perhaps adding return value checking in the caller (though
        this change obviates the need for that).
        
        This addresses CVE-2020-28896.  Thanks to Gabriel Salles-Loustau for
        reporting the problem, and providing test cases to reproduce.

        * Delay $hostname setting until after the muttrc is evaluated.
        
        Commit 5c5c34f2 made back in 1.6 changed Fqdn setting to use
        gethostname() and getaddrinfo() to get the canonical domain.  This is
        more accurate but can cause startup delays for systems where the DNS
        resolution is not set up properly.
        
        Because this occurred before muttrc reading, there was no workaround
        except to "fix DNS".
        
        Change Fqdn ($hostname) setting to occur after the muttrc and '-e'
        argument processing occur.
        
        This is a possible breaking change if users rely on $hostname inside
        their muttrc, for example 'source "muttrc.$hostname"'.  The workaround
        would be to put something like (depending on the system type): 'set
        hostname = `hostname --fqdn`' in the muttrc above that invocation.
        
        Also note that we still set Hostname (the internal variable) early,
        because it is used in more places than Fqdn, such as tempfiles.

        * Remove message-id security leaks section of manual.
        
        The message-id generator has been changed to use a combination of time
        and random components for the left side.

        * Change Message-ID to be more unique and leak less information
        
        A Message-ID should be globally unique. Currently mutt generates this ID
        based on the current date and time, followed by ".G", followed by a letter
        A to Z (A for the 1st and 27th email sent, Z for the 26th, etc.), followed
        by the pid of the active mutt process, followed by "@" and the configured
        fqdn.
        
        This can lead to information being leaked as to an users email habits and
        activities, which might be undesirable.
        
        By replacing everything left of the "@" in the Message-ID with a Base64
        encoded timestamp and 64 bits of randomness, we no longer include this
        information.

        * Implement LFRS113 PRNG functions
        
        - Instead of relying on random() implementations which can be of
        questionable quality or relying on the presence of /dev/urandom, we
        implement our own PRNG implementation that uses the LFRS113 PRNG algorithm
        by Pierre L'Ecuyer.
        
        We seed this PRNG with values based on time, pid and ppid. It is OK if not
        all seeds are of the highest quality as all four seeds would have to be
        known to predict the numbers generated. In addition to this, we also use
        /dev/urandom values (if available) that we mix into our four seeds.
        
        In case we are reseeding we will also reuse our existing state information
        for setting the new seed values.
        
        - Add a function to Base64 encode 96 random bits

        Relative expansion shouldn't be performed when those values are to be

        Change pretty_mailbox() to contract relative paths, but only when the
        folder is outside of homedir, or when cwd is underneath the homedir.

        Unfortunately, it at the same time moved the call *after* the call to
        mutt_window_move(), which would introduce a drawing bug if

        It is called by main menu drawing routines and contains its own

        gets overwritten by the indicator. Furthermore, do_color parameter
        specifically disables any coloring in order for indicator highlight to
        overwrite everything else.

        1) index color;
        2) tree color, that is drawn within menu using its own color;
        3) indicator color, that, if active, is drawn over both of them.
        
        Combining these colors is implemented in that order.
        
        After some testing, I think it doesn't make sense to merge colors when
        $arrow_cursor is on. This part is reverted to the original behavior.
        
        Make print_enriched_string() coloring behavior self-contained, instead
        of assuming the proper base_color is already set.  This makes the
        callers simpler and allows them to only handle $arrow_cursor logic.

        * Add cursor overlay capability.
        
        Currently, when the indicator line is over an unread message, full
        indicator color definition is used, and the line is no longer
        displayed bold. It's harder to notice when using default reverse style
        for the indicator, but it becomes much more prominent when you have
        black on white display and only subtle change in the indicator
        background.
        
        We could improve this by merging indicator color definition with color
        definition of the underlying menu item. Here is how it's done:
        
        1. First color definitions for the indicator and underlying menu item
        are taken and split back to foreground, background and attributes
        (meaning bold, underline, etc.).
        2. If indicator does not specify foreground or background color, new
        color pair is created by using underlying menu item as base. Else
        indicator's own foreground and background are used (current behavior).
        3. Then attributes of both colors are combined together. For example,
        if indicator has 'underline' and menu item has 'bold' result will be
        highlighted as 'bold underline'.
        4. The resulting color is used in place of MT_COLOR_INDICATOR when
        highlighting things in menu.c.
        
        Combining attributes this way makes sense to me, because indicator is
        meant to _indicate_, meaning increasing information density. It also
        looks better when moving through the list containing differently
        styled items.
        
        This patch affects indicator, sidebar_highlight, and sidebar_indicator
        color objects.

        * Add first version of MuttLisp.
        
        This is somewhat simple enhancement to muttrc processing, not a
        full-blown embedded scripting language.  There are no variables,
        functions, types, or abilities that compete with macros.
        
        MuttLisp can be invoked using the "run" command.  If
        $muttlisp_inline_eval is set, it can also be invoked with a bare
        parenthesis expression as a command argument.
        
        $muttlisp_inline_eval defaults unset, to avoid breaking existing
        configurations, which might have bare parenthesis arguments for
        regexps.

        * Improve GPGME inline processing.
        
        Properly deal with multiple blocks:
        
        * Extract the inline block to armored_data, instead of the entire
        message.  Use the code from pgp.c to find the block boundaries.
        
        * The copy_clearsigned() function, probably originally ported from the
        classic code too, assumes the first blank line starts the clear text.
        But this is only true if the passed in data is just the block.
        
        * Use the Charset armor header if found for encrypted content
        conversion, as pgp.d does.
        
        * Reset all states in each loop.
        
        It looks like the pgp.c code wasn't resetting pgp_keyblock and
        gpgcharset, so reset those in pgp.c too.

        Several of the cases are covered by the pipe fixes in the last commit.
        
        The last case is similar to the mutt_view_attachment case.  Since the
        send-mode file might be modified, change it to always save to a
        tempfile and then unstuff the tempfile.

        Since we may need to unstuff the send-mode file, make a copy instead
        of symlinking.  Also clean up the code to just sanitize the filename

        * Create $copy_decode_weed, $pipe_decode_weed, $print_decode_weed.
        
        $weed covers a bit too much functionality.  It makes sense for it to
        control the display of messages in the pager, along with forwarding
        and replying.  But (in my opinion) piping and copy/save-decode are
        something users might like to set differently without affecting the
        rest of Mutt's behavior.
        
        $copy_decode_weed affects the <decode-copy> and <decode-save>
        functions.  I've defaulted this *unset*, despite that it breaks
        backward compatibility, because I believe the header weeding is
        surprising to users and loses important information when copy/saving a
        message.
        
        $pipe_decode_weed affects <pipe-message> when $pipe_decode is set.
        I've default this *set* for backward compatibility.
        
        $print_decode_weed affects <print-message> when $print_decode is set.
        I've default this *set* for backward compatibility.

        * Consider $reply_to before $reply_self.
        
        This is based on Derek Martin's patch in Trac ticket 2304.
        
        I've modified it to:
        
        * default to the value set by OPTREPLYSELF if the
          $ignore_list_reply_to short-circuit fires.
        
        * only apply the "from==reply_to" short circuit when $reply_self would
          indicate replying to from.
        
        * improve the "from==reply_to" short circuit to also fire when the
          display names are equal.
        
        The discussion in the trac ticket was somewhat contentious.  This
        isn't particularly an area in the code I'm eager to touch.  However,
        there are three points worth noting:
        
        1) Mail-Followup-To is considered before $reply_self, so it makes some
        sense for Reply-To to also be.
        
        2) $reply_to is a quadoption, allowing the header to be declined and
        then using $reply_self if appropriate.
        
        3) $reply_self is a boolean.  Previously, the only way to evaluate
        reply_to in these cases is to set $reply_self.  Most users probably
        don't want that set by default, making that a poor workaround.
        
        If this becomes sore point, I'll revert, but I don't believe the
        change will be controversial in practice.

        * Disable hook "command" argument expansion of config variables.
        
        From my email to mutt-dev:
        
          I've been thinking about this a *lot* more, and digging into past
          commits.  It looks like the escaping has pretty consistently been
          intended for value completion and queries.  See commits 3c00eb7a and
          032dcbeb.
        
          I don't believe the escaping is useful for variable expansion as
          part of mutt_extract_token() - even for the hook "command" argument
          case.  The escaping is targeted only for an expression surrounded by
          double quotes (as is generated by completion and queries).  It
          doesn't escape single quotes or spaces, for instance.
        
        Thanks also to Oswald Buddenhagen and Cameron Simpson for their
        feedback.

        * Escape config vars when expanding hook "command" argument.
        
        The "command" parameter of folder, send, send2, account, reply, and
        message hooks is run through mutt_extract_token() twice.  Once when
        parsing the hook command initially, and once via mutt_parse_rc_line()
        when the actual hook fires.
        
        In theory, Mutt users should be aware of this, and should place all
        their command strings with configuration variables in single-quotes,
        to delay expansion until execution.
        
        But in reality Mutt has been escaping configuration variables as part
        of mutt_extract_token() for many years.
        
        The previous commit turned the escaping off, because it damages
        "backup" assignments to a $my_ variable, and I believe is confusing
        behavior.
        
        But for hooks, users now expect the escaping behavior (for
        double-quoted or unquoted command strings).
        
        Note that mutt_parse_hook() also passed the MUTT_TOKEN_SPACE flag, but
        neglected to do so for message-hook.  Since all other "command"
        argument hooks were included, and were added to the list over the
        years, I believe this was an accidental oversight.

        * Convert var_to_string() to use a buffer, and disable auto-escaping.
        
        Inside mutt_extract_token(), expanding a configuration variable used a
        fixed size LONG_STRING.  This would truncate long values, such as
        oauth_refresh, which may have a large token embedded in them.
        
        Convert var_to_string() to use a BUFFER parameter instead.
        
        var_to_string() also performed escaping, which is not always helpful.
        Disable the escaping inside.  Add it back in
        mutt_var_value_complete(), via the pretty_var() call.
        
        The escaping may also be useful for hook "command" parameters.  Since
        Mutt has had the escaping behavior there for years, removing it will
        likely break configurations.  This will be added back in the next
        commit.

        The push/pop menu operations take care of most redraw operations, so

        * Add $tunnel_is_secure config, defaulting set.
        
        The config variable is to resolve an ambiguity in Mutt about whether
        using $tunnel is secure.
        
        On the one hand, the examples in the manual show using ssh or a direct
        pipe to a program.  Many users do this to connect to an IMAP server
        with PREAUTH configured, relying on the tunnel to be secured by ssh or
        by the fact that it's a local pipe.
        
        On the other hand, the Mutt connection code still respects
        $ssl_starttls and $ssl_force_tls, as if the $tunnel connection were
        not already secured.
        
        After some discussion on mutt-dev, it seemed the best idea to assume
        the connection is secure by default, in order to not break IMAP
        PREAUTH connections, but to provide a configuration variable in case
        there are situations where it is not.
        
        Thanks to Aaron Schrab for the original idea of setting conn->ssf for
        $tunnel in his patch to ticket 250.

        * Add basic XOAUTH2 support.
        
        This still relies on an external script to obtain the resource access
        token.  Since XOAUTH2 should be slowly going away, use the same
        refresh_commands as with OAUTHBEARER.
        
        Unlike OAUTHBEARER, XOAUTH2 must be explicitly added to the
        $imap/smtp/pop_authenticators list.
        
        To keep the shared functions simpler, convert them to use buffers.
        
        RFC 7628 indicates that upon authentication failure the clients should
        be sending an BASE 64 encoded '^a' ("AQ=="), to terminate the SASL
        session, so change all the handlers to do that and read the following
        response.  The RFC doesn't comment about a line terminator being
        required, but I assume it is, so add that too.

        * Perform small cleanups in gnutls.c.
        
        These are some cleanups I started making during the stable branch
        fixes committed yesterday.  It seemed a better idea to perform this
        amount of change in master rather than in stable, so they are in this
        separate commit.
        
        Fix the function-call spacing style.
        
        Change the #define CERTERR values to match the pattern used elsewhere
        in mutt.
        
        Use safe_calloc() instead of calloc.
        
        Add a few error checks in tls_get_client_cert(), and change to
        directly extract the CN using gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid().
        
        Use a do-while around the gnutls_handshake() instead of repeating it.

        This will ensure that postponed protected headers will match, in case
        Mutt later adds checks about that.

        * Add other headers to written Protected Headers.
        
        In order to avoid $edit_headers, <resend-message>, or other places
        setting env->date and inadvertantly generating a wrong Date header,
        store the "protected headers" generated date header in the sctx, in
        addition to mime_headers.
        
        I initially removed env->date setting from mutt_parse_rfc822_line(),
        thinking it a more elegant solution, but unfortunately protected
        headers reading needs it to be there.  We don't currently print or
        compare the headers, but might wish to in the future.
        
        Explicitly pass in a date parameters to mutt_write_rfc822_header() to
        make each caller conscious of where the date is coming from.

        * Try to automatically reconnect to an open IMAP mailbox on error.
        
        For the Context, change cmd_handle_fatal() to flag idata->status on
        the error, but not close the mailbox and disconnect.
        
        Then have imap_check_mailbox() reconnect when IMAP_REOPEN_ALLOW is
        set (so the index is prepared to rebuild with all new headers).  Try
        to merge flag, envelope, and attach_del changes back in.  Replace the
        existing Context pointer with the new values, and swap out the idata
        passed in on success, so we don't continue to work with the wrong
        idata.
        
        The imap_check_mailbox() changes are purposely coded loosely to try
        and catch all sorts of errors - not just polling and imap_idle
        errors.
        
        Create a new check_mailbox() return code to indicate a reconnect.
        Display a more appropriate message in the index, but otherwise treat
        it the same as a REOPEN.

        * Remove support for OpenSSL <0.9.5
        
        The current code provides a workaround for the absence of RAND_status in
        OpenSSL versions before 0.9.5. The comments in the code indicate these
        versions have to be supported, but as these versions are now more than
        20 years old, this no longer applies. Removing this support simplifies the
        code and on the small chance that anyone is still using such old versions,
        breaking their build will actually be doing them a favor given the known
        issues with these OpenSSL versions.

          automatically.  This removes the possibility of mistakenly looking
          at an unpopulated 'fname' parameter for the result.
        
        * Create mutt_enter_filename().  This isn't used currently, but it
          makes sense to have a "single filename" api already set up with
          correct parameters.

        * Fix attach-file tag operation to work when quitting browser.
        
        There was a disconnect between the compose menu and the behavior when
        selecting multiple files.  The select_file() operation populates the
        files and numfiles when hitting 'quit'.  The compose menu was
        incorrectly looking at the fname parameter, which won't be populated
        unless the user presses enter.
        
        The enter_string() menu makes the same mistake.  Change it to behave
        differently depending on whether multiple is set.
        
        The logic needs to be made clearer by changing the api.  I will do
        that in the next commit.

        * Adjust message-id extraction to retry more permissively on failure.
        
        It turns out some illegal message-id headers have neither angle
        brackets nor even an '@' in them.  So adopt a different approach.
        
        First try parsing the Message-ID header in a strict(ish) mode
        requiring angle brackets.  If that returns nothing, then try again in
        loose mode, which will basically grab the first non-comment token.
        
        Change References and In-Reply-To to keep the strict(ish) mode.  We
        might loose some parent references, but that won't cause much loss of
        functionality in Mutt, and also helps prevents parsing in "garbage"
        and passing that back in replies.
        
        Thanks to Oswald Buddenhagen for the suggested approach.

        * Loosen message-id parser to parse ids without angle brackets.
        
        To do this, we need to enhance the loop to skip over comments.  It
        does this using the rfc822 address parse_comment() routine.
        
        Keep parsing inside angle brackets non-strict, because of the history
        of trac tickets (1116, 1935, 3090) demonstrating message-ids with
        spaces inside the angle brackets, double-'@'s, or even completely
        missing '@'.
        
        However, in order to reduce the risk of extracting garbage, insist
        that message-id's outside of angle brackets at least have an '@'.
        
        Automatically add missing angle brackets so that Mutt will generate
        valid references/in-reply-to headers.

        * Separate mailbox vs buffy-incoming for the "enter_fname" functions.
        
        Create mutt_buffer_enter_mailbox(), which turns on the MUTT_MAILBOX
        flag (renamed from MUTT_EFILE).  This uses the mailbox history file
        category, and turns on MUTT_SEL_FOLDER in the select_file browser.
        
        Add a do_incoming paramter and a new separate flag MUTT_INCOMING, so
        that buffy-completion can be enabled optionally for mailboxes.  It
        only makes sense for the change-folder operation, so disable it in
        other contexts (such as saving/copying a message, prompting for an Fcc
        mailbox, or an autocrypt scan mailbox).
        
        Change saving/copying a message to use the mailbox function, so that
        it shares the history file with other mailbox operations.  It would
        previously use the "file" history category.
        
        Create mutt_buffer_enter_filenames() to replace the enter_fname()
        prompt for files.
        
        Since nothing directly uses the _mutt_buffer_enter_fname() function
        anymore, rename and make it static.

        * Add utime() loop for _maildir_commit_message().
        
        While fixing up mutt_decrease_mtime(), I thought about creating a
        helper function to loop for EINTR.  However, there is only one other
        place in the code that cares enough about utime succeeding to check
        the return value.
        
        maildir_commit_message() is used fairly often, so it's possible I
        might be writing useless error handling.  However there are
        reports (easily found by internet search) of some systems returning
        EINTR, so might as well fix this place too.

        Add a check for utime failure.  Some non-posix implementations return
        EINTR.  Since editing messages is a very common operation in Mutt,
        take care to retry in that case so as not to introduce message
        composition failures.
        
        Make sure all callers check mutt_decrease_mtime()'s return value,
        since stat could also fail.

        * Support domain-literal values in email adddresses.
        
        RFC 5322 defines the domain-literal:
        
           domain          =   dot-atom / domain-literal / obs-domain
        
           domain-literal  =   [CFWS] "[" *([FWS] dtext) [FWS] "]" [CFWS]
        
           dtext           =   %d33-90 /          ; Printable US-ASCII
                               %d94-126 /         ;  characters not including
                               obs-dtext          ;  "[", "]", or "\"
        
        RFC 5321 defines possible literal values in section 4.1.3.
        
        I think this was unnoticed (and possibly unimplemented) because it's a
        rare use-case.  However, Stuart Gathman @sdgathman in the
        ticket (#226) noted:
        
          The use case is replacing alpine with mutt for this fully
          decentralized usage:
        
          https://fedoramagazine.org/decentralize-common-fedora-apps-cjdns/
        
          The only requirements are to support IPv6 and IPv6 literals (to
          avoid use of DNS).
        
        Adding this slightly complicates the parser, because we can't wait to
        decide whether it's a domain-literal until parse_mailboxdomain(), but
        we also need to accommodate the CFWS.
        
        Break out a parse_domain() function, with partial duplication of
        parse_mailboxdomain()'s logic.
        
        Also, add parse_literal() to the outer parser, because we need to
        handle both name-addr and top level addr-spec.
        
        The RFC822Errors[] are currently unused (and broken), but add a new
        error code and message, in case those get fixed up and introduced to
        the code in the future.
        
        Disable IDNA encoding for domain-literals.

        * olen length requirement was too conservative
        
        When converting binary values to Base 64 encoding, we go from a 8 bit
        representation to a 6 bit representation. As a result, we need extra space
        to store the result compared to the input value being converted.
        
        In the current implementation, the requirements on the size of the output
        buffer are too conservative; We only have to check if the remaining space
        is larger than 4 (3 input bytes get converted into 4 Base64 encoded output
        bytes, plus allowing for a terminating '\0' character) rather than 10.

        * Remove cur parameter for pager recall and make-key ops.
        
        For the recall operation, this can lead to a memory leak where the
        recalled message overwrites the sctx saved data.
        
        Arguably instead, the send_message setup could be more picky about
        saving cur, or recall-message could be careful to not overwrite the
        message-id.
        
        The context parameter isn't actually used for mail-key, and the
        curs_main.c doesn't pass it.  But I can't bring myself to make that

        * Ensure SIGALRM interrupts connect() in batch mode.
        
        Mutt doesn't call mutt_signal_init() in batch mode, which mean no
        default handler for SIGALRM is set in that case.  The man pages seem
        to indicate SIGALRM by default should terminate the process, but
        ticket 273 reported no interruption occurring: Mutt just hung
        indefinitely.
        
        In any case, terminating isn't the desired behavior either.  Add a
        handler, as is done in imap_wait_keepalive() and send_msg().

        If the mailto url was in the second or greater position, beg was on

        recognize the mailto.
        
        Change the loop to skip to the '<' on subsequent loops.  Keep the loop
        iterator the same, to ensure the list-post entries are comma
        separated.
        
        As a note, the parser is still not strictly following the RFC, but
        appears to work well enough in the "real world" that I'm not going to

        * Fix utimensat() to use cwd for relative paths.
        
        The utimensat() invocations were missing the AT_FDCWD parameter,

        I can't remember whether I completely missed that difference from
        utime, or somehow thought all the paths would be full paths.  :-(
        
        In any case, Mutt currently does not expand relative paths in
        mutt_expand_path(), so the paths can most certainly be relative in
        those calls too.

        * Remove $ssl_starttls check for IMAP PREAUTH.
        
        Checking $ssl_starttls provides no real protection, because an
        attacker can just as easily spoof "* OK" and strip the STARTTLS
        capability as it can spoof "* PREAUTH".  The only way to really
        protect again the MITM is through $ssl_force_tls.
        
        Add documentation about STARTTLS, $tunnel, and the current PREAUTH
        exception when using $tunnel.
        
        The behavior of Mutt about $tunnel is somewhat inconsistent: is it
        considered secure or not?  For PREAUTH, to avoid breaking
        configurations, we assume it is secure.  But at the same time, Mutt is
        still negotiating STARTTLS for other $tunnel connections.
        
        This will be resolved in master for the next release; probably by
        adding a $tunnel_is_secure config variable defaulting "yes" and
        removing the STARTTLS negotiation in that case.

        * Fix STARTTLS response injection attack.
        
        Thanks again to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the Münster
        University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue.  Their
        summary in ticket 248 states the issue clearly:
        
          We found another STARTTLS-related issue in Mutt. Unfortunately, it
          affects SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.
        
          When the server responds with its "let's do TLS now message", e.g. A
          OK begin TLS\r\n in IMAP or +OK begin TLS\r\n in POP3, Mutt will
          also read any data after the \r\n and save it into some internal
          buffer for later processing. This is problematic, because a MITM
          attacker can inject arbitrary responses.
        
          There is a nice blogpost by Wietse Venema about a "command
          injection" in postfix (http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html).
          What we have here is the problem in reverse, i.e. not a command
          injection, but a "response injection."
        
        This commit fixes the issue by clearing the CONNECTION input buffer in
        mutt_ssl_starttls().
        
        To make backporting this fix easier, the new functions only clear the
        top-level CONNECTION buffer; they don't handle nested buffering in
        mutt_zstrm.c or mutt_sasl.c.  However both of those wrap the
        connection *after* STARTTLS, so this is currently okay.  mutt_tunnel.c
        occurs before connecting, but it does not perform any nesting.

        * Prevent possible IMAP MITM via PREAUTH response.
        
        This is similar to CVE-2014-2567 and CVE-2020-12398.  STARTTLS is not
        allowed in the Authenticated state, so previously Mutt would
        implicitly mark the connection as authenticated and skip any
        encryption checking/enabling.
        
        No credentials are exposed, but it does allow messages to be sent to
        an attacker, via postpone or fcc'ing for instance.
        
        Reuse the $ssl_starttls quadoption "in reverse" to prompt to abort the
        connection if it is unencrypted.

        * Fix GnuTLS interactive prompt short-circuiting.
        
        tls_verify_peers() doesn't verify expiration dates.  So aborting early
        because of a 0 certstat and the leaf passing tls_check_preauth() does
        not mean subsequent intermediate certs are okay: they could be
        expired.
        
        In the saved-cert preauth loop, instead of just noting the
        tls_check_preauth() rc for the leaf, note the highest cert that passes
        preauth.
        
        Then, in the interactive loop (which goes in the opposite order, from
        CA to leaf) check that value instead.  Since we are trusting certs one
        by one, anything that passed in the previous loop will certainly pass
        the preauth check at the beginning of tls_check_one_certificate().

        GnuTLS is not checking dates because we disabled that in
        tls_negotiate().
        
        So if we don't do this, rejecting an expired intermediate cert will
        have no effect.  Certstat won't contain an expiration error, and
        tls_check_preauth() will only look at each subsequent cert in the
        chain's dates.

        * Fix GnuTLS tls_verify_peers() checking.
        
        * Change the function to pass the certstatus parameter by reference,
        and indicate success/failure of the function via the return value.  It
        was previously returning the certstatus, but was also returning 0 or
        the *unset* certstatus on error too.  Since a 0 certstatus means
        "success", this meant a gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() failure
        would be regarded as a valid cert.
        
        * The gnutls_certificate_type_get() inside tls_verify_peers() checks
        the *client* certificate type.  Since it was only called if
        gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() failed, I assume was either a
        mistake, or perhaps an attempt to give a special error message if the
        client cert was OpenPGP.  In either case, the error message was not
        very informative, so just remove the call and special error message.
        
        * Fix GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND check to be against verify_ret
        instead of certstat.
        
        * Fix gnutls_strerror() call to use verify_ret instead of certstat.
        
        * gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() already calls and checks
        gnutls_auth_get_type(), so remove call at the beginning of
        tls_check_certificate().
        
        * gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() also verifies the certificate
        type for the *server* is GNUTLS_CRT_X509.  Add a comment about that.

        * Fix doc install to check builddir first for bundled files.
        
        Although some of the built files are bundled in the tarball, someone
        could still try to build/install from a git checkout with a separate
        build directory.  There might be other circumstances too, so better to
        just add the check for now.

        The Muttrc needs to be generated because of docdir substitution.  The
        manual.txt may traditionally be generated by a different tool than the
        one on my machine (lynx), so force that to be regenerated too.
        
        It may still be necessary to just rebuild everything, but let's see if
        this will do for stable for now.

        The change to mutt_parse_score() could now result in a NULL score

        happen elsewhere too, so just add a check at the top of

        * Fix buffer pool buffer truncation with my_hdr and score commands.
        
        The buffer pool is now used for command invocation, but unfortunately
        a couple cases of mutt_buffer_init() were hidden in the my_hdr and
        score command processors.
        
        This would result in a shortened buffer being returned to the pool and
        used later for something like the prompt - which expects LONG_STRING
        everywhere.
        
        Fix up the two places to instead copy the string over.  They don't
        need to grab a large buffer pool sized hunk of memory.
        
        Also, fix the mutt_buffer_pool_release() to resize upwards in case
        future code does this.  I should have done this originally, but was
        afraid it would paper over more serious issues.  :-/

        Not doing so caused the subsequent _mutt_enter_string() to use the
        default buffer pool size of 1024 - negating the HUGE_STRING value
        passed into _mutt_get_field().

        A demonstration attack using a million tiny parts will freeze Mutt for
        several minutes.  This is actually better than some other mail
        software, but can still be a problem at large levels.

        * Fix doc installation directories.
        
        The conversion of makedoc.c to perl goofed up the documentation
        build/install process from a tarball.  A late commit, 3c575cab, tried
        to fix this, but didn't fix the problem when building with a separate
        srcdir.
        
        Previously, because makedoc didn't exist, all the documentation would
        be rebuilt, even though it was distributed in the tarball.
        
        Now the files don't need to be rebuilt, and so exist in $(srcdir)
        instead of the build directory.
        
        I'm a little bit unsure how this would all work, trying to install
        from git with a separate srcdir.  I think it would fail now.  However,
        I don't believe that's a common use case.
        
        If I'm wrong, then an alternative would be to go back to rebuilding
        everything.  This would be done by creating a new makedoc target, with
        rule 'cp $(srcdir)/makedoc.pl makedoc', and then changing all the
        other targets to depend on and invoke makedoc instead.

        * Fix edit-message false-modified bug.
        
        The file was being stat() before the truncate, and
        mutt_decrease_mtime() only decreases if the sb.st_mtime is equal to
        the current time.  That means operations crossing the second boundary:
          time x:   stat
          time x+1: truncate, decrease_mtime
        would result in a false-modified bug if no changes were made during
        editing.
        
        The mutt_decrease_mtime() and callers need to be cleaned up for better
        error handling, but I will do that in master.

        * Add missing doc built distfiles.
        
        When building the 1.14.0 release tarball, I discovered a hidden
        dependency problem from switching to makedoc.pl.
        
        The manual.xml is not properly defined, and so trying to build the
        muttrc.man and mutt.info file errors out.  This was previously hidden
        because makedoc need to be compiled, forcing a rebuild.
        
        This problem derives because the stamp-* files (and most of the other
        documentation) are *included* in the tarball, except for muttrc.man
        and mutt.texi.  Those attempt to rebuild, but manual.xml doesn't
        exist.
        
        For now, include muttrc.man and mutt.texi in the dist files.
        
        A better solution requires some thought, but not while I'm trying to
        get a release out.

        * Ensure idata->reopen is clear when the mailbox is closed.
        
        Commit ab457327 accidentally introduced a performance regression in
        the 1.13.0 release.  The reason is that imap_sync_mailbox() was
        leaving IMAP_REOPEN_ALLOW set.  When a mailbox was closed, and another
        opened, the imap_open_mailbox() would be processed with the reopen
        set.
        
        The initial connection and exec statements would trigger a
        imap_cmd_finish().  That would then prematurely trigger fetching new
        mail, with the newMailCount misset, which would in turn generate a
        tiny uid_hash.  When the real download occurred, it would use the
        existing tiny hash, throttling performance.
        
        The regression commit removed what I thought was an unnecessary check,
        but it was guarding the fetch from happening at the wrong time during
        mailbox open too.
        
        The performance issue was already addressed by commit a8337951 in
        master, but I think it's good to wipe the entire state.  The removes
        other possible strange behavior.
        
        A HUGE thanks to Guilhem Moulin for his help on this issue.  Without
        all his work detailing the problem, creating automated testing, git
        bisecting, and logging, I would not have been able to find and fix the
        problem.

        read_headers_condstore_qresync_updates() differs from

        for existing messages in the context.
        
        So cmd_parse_fetch() will process the flags *but* it will also
        increment/decrement context flag counters.

        mx_update_context() set them properly afterwards.

        * Turn off writing exact-addresses that require 2047-encoding.
        
        The full strdup'ed copy of the address can't be properly encoded
        without significant rework to parse, encode, and reassemble.
        (Additionally, IDNA is not being performed on the domain written in
        the exact-address string.)
        
        As an example, consider the current exact address behavior, given the
        three addresses:
          "ascii name" (comment) <addr@example.com>
          The ènd (comment) <addr2@example.com>
          "The ènd" (comment) <addr3@example.com>
        
        Before this commit, when sending Mutt would generate:
          "ascii name" (comment) <addr@example.com>
          The =?iso-8859-1?B?6G5kIChjb21tZW50KSA8YWRkcjJAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20+?=
          =?iso-8859-1?B?IlRoZSDobmQiIChjb21tZW50KSA8YWRkcjNAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20+?=
        
        The second address 2047 encodes everything starting with ènd,
        including the comment and address.  The third address is completely
        encoded.
        
        A "quick workaround" I proposed to the list was turning off
        encode_specials.  This results in:
          "ascii name" (comment) <addr@example.com>
          The =?iso-8859-1?B?6G5k?= (comment) <addr2@example.com>
          "The =?iso-8859-1?Q?=E8nd=22?= (comment) <addr3@example.com>
        
        That solves the second case, but in the third case 2047-encodes
        ènd" - including the trailing double quote.
        
        With this patch, we turn off writing the exact address if encoding is
        needed, generating:
          "ascii name" (comment) <addr@example.com>
          The =?iso-8859-1?B?6G5k?= <addr2@example.com>
          The =?iso-8859-1?B?6G5k?= <addr3@example.com>
        
        This reverts to Mutt-generated normalized form in the last two
        addresses, which require encoding.  For the first case it preserves
        the address as "typed" by the user.

        Modify the crypt handlers to return 1 if any kind of state message is

        for now just consider a handler error that notifies by
        state_attach_puts() as "non-fatal".

        * Display error if no imap authenticators are available.
        
        Without SASL enabled, and with an explicit value in
        $imap_authenticators not natively implemented by Mutt, no calls to
        authenticator->authenticate() were occuring.
        
        This resulted in the default r value of -1 passing through, which did
        not trigger the mutt_error() message after the loop.
        
        Without that message, an empty index would display with the
        "connecting" message still on the bottom, giving the appearance that
        Mutt is hung.

        When copying from local to IMAP, it would previously only display a
        percentage count for each individual message.  Suppress that by
        passing MUTT_QUIET.
        
        Note, this is only for "regular" copies.  IMAP server-side copies
        happen in a single command and can't display a progress meter.

        * Turn off REOPEN flag after imap open and sync operations.
        
        Leaving a just opened imap mailbox with REOPEN set can cause all sorts
        of problems.  Postpone.c had a memory corruption bug because of this.
        The background compose reply-flag setting code had to ensure it was
        turned off too.
        
        The main index worked around this by always ensuring
        mx_check_mailbox() was called right afterwards.  But after researching
        I can't see any reason to leave it open.
        
        imap_sync_mailbox() also leaves the REOPEN set, and I can't see a good
        reason for doing this either.  Both are memory corruption bugs just
        waiting to happen.
        
        With the flag turned off, remove the workaround calls to
        mx_check_mailbox() in postpone.c and send.c.

        parts.

        * Add "root" disposition to attachments command.
        
        An initial inline part was previously always skipped, for the good
        reasons outlined by @dgc in #217.
        
        Unfortunately, some mail clients have started sending "attachments" as
        the root (and only) part, more and more lately.  Although this may be
        bad practice, Mutt should support counting these as "attachments".
        
        To do so without breaking existing configs, add a "root" disposition
        argument to the attachments command.  This will count an initial
        inline part in a message or multipart container.
        
        The existing code skipped counting for the "top-level" and recursive
        calls, so group both of these cases under "root".

        * Change disabled crypto pattern op error message and return value.
        
        If mutt is compiled without crypto support, attempting to use one of
        the patterns ~g, ~G, ~k, ~V fails with the cryptic (pun intended)
        error message:
          "error: unknown op %d (report this error)."
        
        Since the op is known, just not enabled, and furthermore is an opaque
        number, it doesn't help the user understand what the problem is.
        
        Change the code to instead print out the pattern operator character
        that is disabled:
          "Pattern operator '~%c' is disabled."
        
        Almost all callers of mutt_pattern_exec() expect it to return 0 or 1.
        Returning -1 in the event of a disabled or bad op will lead to
        undesirable "matching" behavior.  Change to return 0 in the event of
        one of these errors, since none of the callers do (or can) handle the
        error in a meaningful way.

        * Convert mutt_parse_rc_line() to use real buffer to hold the line.
        
        Previously, the parameter converted into a kind of read-only buffer,
        pointing to the char *line passed in.  The problem is that
        mutt_extract_token() backtick processing allocates and assigns a new
        token->data.
        
        As a result, buffer->destroy was added, whose sole purpose is to keep
        track of the read-only token buffer being reallocated so that it can
        be properly freed inside mutt_parse_rc_line().  (The char *line is
        allocated and freed in source_rc()).
        
        Remove the token parameter, and convert line to a const char *.  Copy
        that into a buffer-pool buffer, so the buffer can be modified
        "normally".
        
        Create a mutt_buffer_rc_buffer() function taking the line buffer
        parameter.  To make the source_rc() just a tiny bit faster, have it
        directly manage and call mutt_parse_rc_buffer() itself.
        
        Other callers likely don't need the speed, so remove their cumbersome
        creation/free of that parameter.
        
        The next commit will deal with removing buffer->destroy and fixing up
        backtick handling.

        * Fix up mailboxes documentation synopsis.
        
        Specify the flags as type "option", instead of as parameters.

2020-03-25 15:07:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (1487ea64)

        * Add -label and -nopoll arguments to mailboxes command
        
        -nopoll allows adding the mailbox to the sidebar, or the mailbox
        browser menu, without incurring polling costs.
        
        -poll can be used to re-enable polling for a previously disabled
        mailbox.
        
        -label allows specifying an alternative string to show in the sidebar
        and mailbox browser menu.
        
        -nolabel removes a label from an existing mailbox.
        
        Change $sidebar_sort_method so that "alpha" and "name" will sort by
        the label if specified.  "path", however, will always sort by the
        actual mailbox path.

        * Minor sidebar HilIndex and redraw cleanup.
        
        Ensure HilIndex is reset to -1 if all mailboxes are hidden, preventing
        <sidebar-open> from opening a hidden mailbox in that case.
        
        Previously, draw_sidebar() would still be triggered in that case,
        causing an empty loop to run and trailing space to be drawn.  But with
        this change TopIndex and BottomIndex will still be -1 in that case.
        
        Change the prepare_sidebar() return value to check if HilIndex is set,
        and if mutt_sb_draw() to clear out in that case.

        * Clarify PGP Pseudo-header S<id> duration.
        
        Due to the background edit changes, S<id> values are now assigned to
        the send-context, not to $pgp_sign_as.  The duration of the change is
        no longer permanent.

2020-03-19 15:12:49 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (ab790a7d)

        * Add $fcc_delimiter, to allow multiple Fcc mailboxes.
        
        The variable defaults unset, to prevent breaking anyone's
        configuration.
        
        If set to a value, such as ",", $record and fcc-hook may list multiple
        mailboxes separated by the delimiter.  Mutt will tokenize and
        expand/prettify each separate mailbox.  At Fcc time, it will loop
        through trying to save to each mailbox.
        
        This patch introduces a bit more uglyness into init.c, which has to
        special-process for $record in a few places.  I don't like that, but I
        believe the feature is important enough to allow for the one-off
        behavior hack, because we are constrained by backwards compatibility.
        
        Add documentation notes about the resulting issues with '<' mailbox
        shortcut expansion, and with fcc-save-hook processing.  It is
        recommended to use fcc-hook to set multiple mailboxes in those cases
        instead.

        * Add $folder to send scope.
        
        It's hard to know where to draw the line on scope variables, but
        $folder seems likely to change across "account switches" and will
        affect Fcc pretty_mailbox and expansion.  The user can also manually
        change Fcc from the compose menu.
        
        If spoolfile or infile complaints come in, I can add that, but I'm not
        convinced those will commonly be an issue for sending emails.

        * Convert progress and socket_poll millis to unsigned long long.
        
        64-bit platforms should already be using a 64-bit tv_sec, so we should
        use the same for the millis values.

        * Change mutt_FormatString() data parameter to type void *.
        
        All invocations pass a pointer parameter.  Perhaps at one point this
        was like the init.h combined usage.  But as with that, using an
        unsigned long is incorrect, and we've been lucky to get away with it.
        Since we don't need a union, just change it to void * to properly size
        the parameter.

        * Fix for $recall part 2.
        
        Fix the sctx->flags check further below too.  Now that
        SENDBACKGROUNDEDIT is added, a direct comparison is incorrect.

M	send.c

2020-03-03 10:18:45 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (63cb4e9f)

        * Fix $recall prompting.
        
        The background-edit added a flag for the <mail> operation, so the
        previous test for !flags now always fails.
        
        I don't see a more elegant fix, other than changing it to match
        SENDBACKGROUNDEDIT, plus the existing test for sctx->msg being NULL.
        
        Add a comment because the flag test is confusing otherwise.

2020-03-02 14:05:49 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (fa8702ff)

        * Add $status_format 'B' expando for backgrounded count.
        
        Add "%?B? Back:%B?" to the default $status_format.
        
        Rather than iterating ProcessList for each status bar refresh, just
        add a counter in background.c.

        Despite MUTT_QUIET, there are still messages displayed by opening an
        IMAP mailbox, so refresh the message.

2020-03-01 14:20:39 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (1399257d)

        There are still connection related messages, but at least reduce the
        number of messages.

        - index and pager send operations.
        
        - query menu and resending.
        
        - recvattach operations.
        
        I initially thought there were complications, but the attachment menu
        decouples everything from the ATTACH_CONTEXT and doesn't free things
        before they are used.

        * Clean up background edit landing page.
        
        Try to get the OP_EXIT keybinding and print that instead.
        
        Manually center the strings, to avoid negative column computations.
        Allow overruns though - it's just a landing page.  The message is more
        important than a possible sidebar overwrite due to a tiny window.

        * Set reply flags when backgrounded.
        
        Store security and message_id fields to deal with replies without
        access to cur in the resumable part.
        
        Reopen the correct mailbox if it has changed.
        
        Display a message when setting reply flags, in case there is a
        noticeable pause.

        * Confirm exiting if background edit processes exist.
        
        This prompt is in addition to the $quit prompt.  A bit annoying, but I
        believe necessary to combat muscle memory and avoid losing compose
        sessions.

        This makes it more noticable that the parameter may be freed, and also
        prevents a use after free.

        List the backgrounded sessions.  Allow the user to resume one, or exit
        the menu.
        
        Bind to 'B' by default in the index and pager menus.
        
        Remove the "<mail>" function autoresuming functionality, instead
        invoke the menu to resume backgrounded sessions.

        * Save and restore a subset of config variables when backgrounding.
        
        Save all the booleans, quadoptions, along with:
          $record
          $postponed
          $envelope_from_address
          $from
          $sendmail

          $pgp_sign_as
          $smime_sign_as
          $smime_encrypt_with
        
        This is to prevent multiple background compose sessions from
        interfering with each other, along with account/folder changes made
        while in the index menu.

        * Add background edit landing page.
        
        The landing page waits for the $editor process to exit, or until the
        user presses <exit>, "q" by default.  If they press exit they are
        returned to the index.  If the $editor exits first, they are returned
        directly to the compose process.

        * Enable backgrounding a single <mail> function.
        
        Backgrounding exits to the index menu.  Re-invoking <mail> will resume
        the backgrounded session, if one exists, otherwise start a new
        session.
        
        This is just to get basic support going.  Multiple background edits, a
        landing page, a background compose menu list will be added next.

        Add a "cleared" bit for smime_crypt_alg.  Otherwise clearing the value
        in smime.c's menu would cause the compose menu and mutt_protect() to
        fall back to using SmimeCryptAlg.

        This will help distinguish mutt_send_message() and

        Otherwise the names are too similar and confusing.

        Place num_hidden in all the collapsed thread messages, rather than
        just the visible ones (i.e. the root headers).
        
        This is a tweak to commit 0f8a079d, where I discovered the behavior
        inconsistent with the documentation.  I'm making this change in master
        due to the (tiny) behavior change.

        * Add move-up and move-down functions to compose menu.
        
        This adds the ability to rearrange the order of the attachments,
        including swapping the first attachment if desired.
        
        The compose menu doesn't support nested attachments, but since data
        structures and code are shared with recvattach, the new functions use
        the v2r and try to behave sensibly with respect to parent pointer
        adjustments.
        
        However, the functions do restrict movement to be between siblings.
        Adding code to support cross-tree movement would be more complicated
        for no current purpose.

        This allows searching the message body or headers for making
        configuration settings.
        
        Right now, this only searches the primary message content.  I don't
        think it would be useful to search attachments, but if I'm wrong we
        can add iteration later.

        Make it the same as with pgpkey.c and crypt-gpgme.c, to remove
        confusion in the future about this (as I had briefly).
        
        This is also needed because the
        $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt_strong_keys logic added to smime.c relies
        on the "may_ask" parameter being a reflection of oppenc mode, not just
        a "quiet" mode.

        My perl is pretty rusty, and the result isn't super pretty.  However,

        use that.  The output of Muttrc, muttrc.man, and manual.xml match.

        The answer is: for Enigmail yes. Otherwise it ignores protected headers
        and use the envelope headers. This results in all the emails listed with
        "..." subject, which isn't very helpful.
        
        Since the user can disable protected headers while in the compose menu
        (after potentially failed send), remove the attribute if protected
        headers are disabled.

        * Fixes and cleanup for imap deflate patch.
        
        Rework mutt_zstrm_read():
        - Pass along the error if conn_read() returns < 0.
        - Separate out conn_eof and stream_eof flags so they can be dealt
          with differently.
        - Don't use Z_FINISH on conn_eof, because the passed in buf might
          not be big enough to hold the decompressed output.  Instead continue
          looping until either Z_STREAM_END or Z_BUF_ERROR.
        - Remove recursive calls to retry, instead goto 'retry' target.
        - Remove op statements in malloc/free.
        - Bail on other rcs.  Mutt doesn't check errno on a read error, so
          lump all other error codes into a -1 return value.  Use default so
          we handle other weird stuff such as Z_NEED_DICT or Z_STREAM_ERROR
          too.
        
        Convert $imap_deflate to boolean, default unset.
        
        Configure.ac fixes:
        - Fix indentation
        - Remove unneeded AM_CONDITIONAL.
        - Don't restore LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS.  Save and restore LIBS instead.
        
        imap_conn_find() fixes:
        - Don't queue CAPABILITY command.  (This mistake has been in there
          since UTF-8 and QRESYNC were added.).
        - Check imap_exec() returns 0 before wrapping.  Even with FAIL_OK set,
          the imap_exec() can still return -1 on some errors.

        - added mutt_zstrm which allows wrapping an existing connection with
          deflate/inflate (zlib compression)
        - call mutt_zstrm_wrap_conn when setting up an IMAP connection if the
          server supports COMPRESSION=DEFLATE and imap_deflate evaluates to yes
        - add config quad-option imap_deflate enable/disable use of
          (de)compression for IMAP connections, defaulting to yes
        - add configure check for zlib, --with-zlib to detect if mutt_zstrm can
          (or should) be built
        
        Tested against a Dovecot IMAP server, observed easily 7x compression
        rates on received data, and 5x on sent data for a normal session.  Rates
        can be observed when the connection is closed on debug level 4 and
        higher.

        * Ensure format string dest buffer is cleared for callback function.
        
        There is some variation in Mutt as to the behavior of an undefined
        expando.  Some functions pass the op through, some output nothing.
        
        Unfortunately, a few callback functions also don't ensure the dest
        buffer is cleared if no expandos match the passed in op.  This is
        mostly my fault - I think I added a few using addrbook as a template,
        which was unfortunately missing the default clear switch.
        
        Rather than adding it to the places a default is missing, just ensure
        it's cleared in mutt_FormatString() itself, which will prevent future
        mistakes too.

        * Fix crash when syncing large IMAP mailboxes.
        
        imap_sync_mailbox() and imap_exec_msgset() make a copy of the headers
        before resorting them to generate a message-set, to avoid context
        changes.  I noticed the oddity in the past but didn't investigate
        deeply enough at the time. :-/
        
        The code in imap_sync_mailbox() was wrong for four reasons:
        1) Because IMAP_REOPEN_ALLOW is set, sync_helper() can trigger
           an imap_exec if the queue fills up, resulting in new messages
           being downloaded or expunges being triggered.
        
        2) The copy was only allocating msgcount headers, instead of hdrmax.
           Downloading new messages could then attempt to append beyond the end
           of the array if hdrmax > msgcount.
        
        3) New messages or expunges would disappear when the copy was restored
           afterwards.
        
        4) The callers of mx_sync_mailbox() are prepared for context changes,
           and will adjust the cursor properly to avoid jumps.
        
        The same problems can occur in imap_exec_msgset() when reopen is set.
        Not all of its callers enable reopen, or are prepared to deal with
        context changes though, so the copy is needed when reopen is not set.
        
        An alternative solution tried converting to call mutt_sort_headers()
        when possible.  However that solution turned out to visibly slow down
        syncs due to the double sorting.
        
        This commit instead turns off reopen for the duration of the msgset
        operations.
        
        While verifying all queued operations are flushed, I noticed the
        initial "quick delete" in imap_sync_mailbox() did not seem to be
        guaranteed to flush.  Ensure the imap_exec() further below is
        triggered if either the quick delete or sync_helper calls generate
        changes.  Change the quick delete to assign to "quickdel_rc" to make
        it clear the flush below is for both.
        
        Change the post sync/msgset check to look for both ((oldsort != Sort)
        || hdrs), just to make sure a memory leak doesn't occur.

        * Speed up thread sort when many long threads exist.
        
        Merge request !75 reported a massive slowdown opening a mailbox with
        many long threads: on the order of an hour.
        
        This is because mutt_set_virtual() was iterating through the whole
        thread for each message.
        
        After taking a closer look at current Mutt behavior, it seems the
        num_hidden count is only needed in the root thread.  Quoting my
        comment in the merge request:
        
          The index-format expando %M only applies to root level headers, so
          there are no issues there.
        
          The only concern is the pattern ~v. Limiting always resets collapsed
          and num_hidden, so there also can't be any issues there. Tagging and
          other pattern operators only work on visible messages. So tagging
          while threads are sorted will only tag the root messages of
          collapsed threads.
        
          However, if you sort by thread, collapse a thread, and then sort by
          date, the collapsed and num_hidden fields are not reset for each
          header. In theory this would allow us to tag ~v with date
          ordering. However, in master the num_hidden is only set (by
          mutt_set_virtual()) for visible messages with a virtual number.
        
          So even in master, switching to date-order and tagging ~v will only
          tag the root messages of each collapsed thread.
        
        This commit removes the num_hidden setting in mutt_set_virtual(),
        instead directly assigning that value in the roothdr during a collapse
        operation.
        
        A subsequent commit will fix the behavior of ~v, when switching
        sorting from threaded to something else, by putting num_hidden in
        every header in the thread.  This is technically a change in behavior,
        so I will make that commit in the master branch.
        
        Thanks to Score_Under for the pull request and for testing my
        alternate solutions.

        In theory it's a good idea encourage SSL usage everywhere.
        
        However ticket #210 showed that, in reality, that kind of change
        breaks configs and so is still not a good idea.
        
        $ssl_startls defaults set and will use STARTTLS if the server
        advertises it.

        * Fix rendering of replacement_char when Charset_is_utf8
        
        Use mutt_addwch instead of addch to draw the replacement_char in
        pager.c. The line to draw the replacement char was
        addch (replacement_char ())
        However, if Charset_is_utf8 is true, replacement_char returns 0xfffd,
        which is outside the range that addch can handle. Use mutt_addwch
        instead so that the pager displays the replacement char properly.

        * Fix crash when polling a closed ssl connection.
        
        Commit 8353407c enabled checking for buffered OpenSSL/GnuTLS data when
        polling, but neglected to check if the connection was already closed.
        
        This can be triggered during imap_logout() if the connection write of
        "LOGOUT" fails and closes the connection, before the poll.  It's a bit
        tricky to trigger because imap_logout_all() checks for a closed
        connection, so the failure needs to take place at that last write.
        
        Thanks to Stefan Sperling for pointing out the problem, complete with
        a backtrace and patch.  (This commit takes a different approach for a
        stable-branch fix.)

        * Turn off auto-clear outside of autocrypt initialization.
        
        The auto-clearing code was added in commit 01bc088c, for autocrypt
        initial prompting.  It removed having to keep track of every place a
        browser or other menu might be displayed and having to remember to
        clear it out.
        
        However, clearing when mutt exits is a change of behavior for those
        who have turned off alternative screens.

        * Fix segv in IMAP postponed menu caused by reopen_allow.
        
        imap_open_mailbox() leaves IMAP_REOPEN_ALLOW set for the connection.
        I noticed this previously but didn't bother untangling the logic yet
        because the index always calls mx_check_mailbox() right away, which
        unsets the flag.
        
        However, when debugging the segv for commit 51729d8d I realized the
        postponed menu/context also suffers from the problem, leaving the menu
        ripe for segvs due to unmanaged expunges.
        
        I believe imap_read_headers() turns it off and back on to avoid
        goofing up imap_cmd_finish() when a reopen *is* allowed.
        
        The logic needs to be cleaned up and fixed.  However for a stable
        branch fix, I'm am taking a conservative approach and just calling
        mx_check_mailbox() to turn it back off.

        * Fix imap postponed mailbox use-after-free error.
        
        mutt_get_postponed() was calling mx_close_mailbox(), but not checking
        the return value.  Because the postponed context is an actual
        read-write, selected mailbox in a new connection, a failed close left
        a dangling pointer in connection->idata->ctx.
        
        imap_keepalive() traversed the connection list, finding the Postponed
        connection still there, and passed the dangling pointer to
        imap_check_mailbox.
        
        Change an empty postponed mailbox to just call fastclose.  Change the
        other closes to retry on a postive return code "reopen" event and then
        finally just call fastclose.
        
        Outside the index and postponed menu, Mutt's code only uses append or
        readonly temporary contexts.  Those are guaranteed to call
        mx_fastclose_mailbox() and return 0.

        Rename to $sidebar_use_mailbox_shortcuts.  The shortening wasn't that
        much shorter and made the name confusing.
        
        To prevent complaints in the future as others transition to 1.13,

        In actuality, the parent_depth and indent_width won't ever be
        negative.
        
        But the new code for unset $sidebar_relative_shortpath_indent makes
        this much less obvious.  Better to be explicit than have some small
        future code change result in a bug.

        When unset this option provides the pre-1.13.0 sidebar indentation and

        Setting the option will enable the new (relative to previous entries)
        indentation and shortening behavior.

        $sidebar_use_mb_shortcuts, which defaults set.

        recommendation engine or autocrypt menu were invoked.  This would
        cause the actual encryption to fail when sending.
        
        This was hidden by the $crypt_opportunistic_encrypt config, which does
        ensure it gets turned on.  I can only guess that this variable is
        popular with the autocrypt early adopters too.
        
        Also explicity enable APP_PGP for $autocrypt_reply.  We can't rely on
        $crypt_autopgp to turn this on.

        * Add ability to generate multipart/alternative using a filter script.
        
        Create config variables $send_multipart_alternative (a quadoption)
        and $send_multipart_alternative_filter.  The filter script expects
        output to be the mime type, a blank line, then the content.
        
        Add ability to preview alternative from compose menu.  <view-alt-text>
        forces viewing as text.  <view-alt-mailcap> forces using the mailcap.
        Bind them to 'v' and 'V', respectively.
        
        Improve <resend-message> so a multipart/alternative is stripped out,
        which would just confuse the compose menu.  Currently this preserves
        the first alternative.
        
        Allow alternative generation in batch mode, as long as the quadoption
        is set to 'yes'.

        Since we will be dealing with multipart/alternative, we need the

        MS Outlook seems to add charset=charset=utf-8 to Content-Type, which

        Changing folder from within the pager behaved inconsistently when

        and other times return to the index.
        
        Ensure it returns to the pager, except in the case where
        mx_close_mailbox() fails due to a new mail or reopen event.  In that

        As noted in commit a327386c, this causes problems when redirecting ops
        that open new menus.  There is no need to change the menu->menu type,
        as a flag works perfectly well with no such side effects.
        
        This also removes the need for comments explaning the hack before
        mutt_folder_hooks() when changing folders, or before displaying a
        message in the pager.

        * Stable branch quick fix for pager change-mailbox push/exec bug.
        
        The menu functions mutt_push/pop_current_menu() keep track of the menu
        stack, automatically setting CurrentMenu when exiting menus.
        
        The only gotcha was the function sharing between the index and pager
        menus.  The index uses a hack, setting menu->menu to MENU_PAGER for
        operations redirecting through the index and back to the pager
        afterwards.
        
        I thought this was covered by the restoration of the menu before
        returning to the pager, or when exiting the index switch.  However it
        is not: invoking other menus, such as the browser, will result in
        CurrentMenu being set to the Pager when exiting those (by
        mutt_pop_current_menu()).  This can result in folder hooks failing for
        unshared functions.
        
        A better fix is to remove the hack of using menu->menu, because this
        can easily cause a problem in the future in other situations.  (I will
        make this fix in master next.)  For the stable branch, I am explicitly
        setting/restoring CurrentMenu before invoking the folder hooks.

        * Clear connection input buffer when closing.
        
        An RFC-violating reply from the Dovecot SMTP submission service
        uncovered a bug in Mutt.  Mutt was not clearing out the input buffer
        when closing the connection.
        
        Dovecot was including an extra 250 response after data submission:
        
          DATA
          354 OK
          Subject: Test 3
        
          Test 3
          .

          quit
          221 2.0.0 Bye
        
        The multiline 250 reply requires a hyphen in the first response.  Mutt
        closes the connection after the quit, but ends up leaving the
        unexpected second line in the input buffer.  This causes an error in
        the next usage of the connection.

        * Improve sidebar indentation and shortpath behavior.
        
        The previous implementation only enabled $sidebar_folder_indent for
        mailboxes underneath $folder.  Change indentation to be based upon the
        previous common-path mailbox in the list.  Indent one more than the
        common-path mailbox, rather than the number of delimiters after
        $folder.
        
        Change $sidebar_short_path to shorten based on the previous mailbox in
        the list too.
        
        Invoke mutt_buffer_pretty_mailbox() to prefix the mailbox with '~' or
        '=' characters.  This changes the output for the case where mailbox
        equals $folder, but provides uniform display behavior across mutt.

        * Rename browser fields to display_name and full_path.
        
        Mailbox and Folder view don't make use of the desc field.  They store
        an abbreviated version in the name field and expand it when selecting
        or testing it.
        
        IMAP stores the full URL in name, and stores an abbreviated
        version (possibly with a trailing slash) in the desc field.
        
        The asymetricity makes it awkward, and interferes with a smart-cursor
        option in the next commit.  So instead rename the fields to
        "display_name" and "full_path".
        
        In Mailfox and Folder view, store the fully expanded path, which we
        have while iterating, in "full_path", and the shortened version in
        "display_name".
        
        Likewise in IMAP, store the full URL in "full_path" and the shortened
        version in "display_name".
        
        Simplify the code in browser.c to use the full_path instead of
        concatenating and expanding.

        * Fix memory leak when attaching messages.
        
        Setting actx->idx[]->content->parts to NULL causes a memory leak,
        because message attachments store a BODY there that needs to be freed.
        
        I looked through the various use cases of ci_send_message() and
        actually believe content->parts will be NULL for all other cases
        except message attachments.  From the comment added to
        delete_attachment():
        
          Other ci_send_message() message constructors are careful to free
          any body->parts, removing depth:
           - mutt_prepare_template() used by postponed, resent, and draft files
           - mutt_copy_body() used by the recvattach menu and $forward_attachments.
        
          I believe it is safe to completely remove the "content->parts =
          NULL" statement.  But for safety, am doing so only for the case
          it must be avoided: message attachments.

        * Re-enable and cleanup format-flowed space stuffing.
        
        Commit 04cb5bde tried to fix re-stuffing a postponed message more than
        once, but unfortunately broke the normal case of composing a new
        message.  So actually, space-stuffing has been turned off the past 7
        years.
        
        Move format=flowed parameter setting below the standard message
        pre-processing block.  It shouldn't be performed for draft-files even
        with $resume_draft_files set.  Moving out of the block makes that
        clearer.
        
        Create mutt_rfc3676_space_(un)stuff() functions, which check the
        content type and stuff/unstuff apprpropriately.  Note that the
        stuff/unstuff does not depend on $text_flowed, which is only in charge
        of setting the format=flowed parameter.  This parameter can also come
        from resumed/resent/draft messages and should still be respected.
        
        Add unstuffing to mutt_prepare_template().  This is called by
        postponed, resent, and draft files.  This will prevent double-stuffing
        in those cases.
        
        Unstuff/restuff around editing the message in the compose menu, to
        keep everything transparent to the user.  I originally put the
        stuffing *after* the compose menu, but previewing the messages in the
        compose menu did not work properly in that case.  It's cleaner this
        way too.
        
        Change the stuff/unstuff functions to preserve the original
        hdr->content->filename.  The "hack" previously used would interact
        poorly with editable body files (mutt -i -E).  Fortunately space
        stuffing was pretty much disabled except in unusual cases before.

        The intention of the term "collapse" is something like opening and

        * Update autocrypt keyring documentation.
        
        Recommend setting $autocrypt_dir to your normal keyring directory if
        you want to use your existing key.
        
        Trying to copy it over leads to signature verification issues.  Even
        if I reversed the order (which is much less clean), that would just
        lead to missing key signature errors for Autocrypt messages instead.

        * Fix --with-sqlite3 test for autocrypt.

        Although it would be nice to "open this up" more, performance and
        security/stability issues would arise.
        
        Based on the thread in mutt-dev, I hope these vars will satisfy most
        customization needs:
          $size_show_bytes

        * Add checks for buffered OpenSSL or GnuTLS data when polling.
        
        I don't believe this has had an actual effect, because Mutt doesn't
        support renegotiation, and we are only polling immediately after
        sending NOOP.
        
        However, it looks like checking is technically the correct thing to do
        to avoid polling waiting for data that is already buffered.

        * Turn off macro processing during autocrypt initialization.
        
        The muttrc can push events into the macro buffer, with the assumption
        that mailbox will be opened next.  This will interfere with the
        prompts uses during first run.  The only issue is that macros won't
        work inside the folder browser, if invoked.

        This will be needed for the first-run of autocrypt initialization.
        The initialization involves a number of prompts, and can even use the

        Change crypt_get_keys() to query autocrypt.
        
        When oppenc_mode is set, we still query the original keyring
        regardless, because the compose menu can still run oppenc even if
        autocrypt is on.
        
        Since mutt_autocrypt_ui_recommendation() checks each key as part of
        making the recommendation, add a keylist parameter and use that

        * Add a comment to the OPTIGNOREMACROEVENTS km_dokey() change.
        
        The option was added in commit 53900afa, and its actual purpose was
        to separate out an "unget" event buffer from the "macro" buffer, to
        solve a problem with certificate prompts.
        
        The safest approach in a low-level function like km_dokey() was to
        return an error if new macros were generated when the option is set.
        However, this results in an unbuffered username/password prompt being
        aborted.
        
        Currently the only users of unbuffered input are the SSL certificate
        prompts, which use menu->dialog mode (and thus mutt_getch() directly)
        and username/password prompts.  So the only affected cases are
        editor-menu prompts, and returning the pressed keys is likely less
        surprising than aborting the prompt.
        
        If other unbuffered menus are created in the future, we may want to
        add a check for which menu mode is being used.

        * Omit User-Agent: header by default
        
        The User-Agent: header can be fun and interesting and useful for
        debugging, but it also leaks quite a bit of information about the user
        and their software stack.
        
        This represents a potential security risk (attackers can target the
        particular stack) and also an anonymity risk (a user trying to
        preserve their anonymity by sending mail from a non-associated account
        might reveal quite a lot of information if their choice of mail user
        agent is exposed).
        
        Users who want to configure `user_agent` to `yes` can still do so, but
        it makes sense to have safer defaults.

        * Remove unnecessary "" checks for DT_STR and DT_PATH MuttVars.
        
        MuttVars of those types are set via safe_strdup(), which returns NULL
        if the original is "".  Thus Var implies *Var.
        
        A good portion of the code relies on that axiom, but over the years
        some (Var && *Var) checks have crept in, including from me.
        
        This was partially because of the INITVAL("") that were in the code,
        which implied (incorrectly) the initial value could be "".  Commit
        2f91d43e removed those to make it more clear.
        
        This commit removes the *Var checks to make it even clearer, and help
        avoid them creeping back in again.

        * Convert $header_cache_pagesize to type DT_LNUM.
        
        Prior to commit 4bc76c2f there was no LNUM type, and so the workaround
        was to store it as a string, converting in the hcache_open_gdbm()
        call.
        
        This will not affect the user interface or config file, because DT_NUM
        and DT_LNUM read in a string from the config file and convert to a
        number.  Quotes are used for escaping style, not passed through to the
        variable setter.
        
        So essentially this simply moves the conversion to parse_set(), and
        provides feedback for a non-numeric type immediately.

        * Convert Commands to use the union pointer_long_t too.
        
        As with MuttVars, Commands was using an unsigned long to hold pointers
        as well as enums.  Convert to use the same union type of MuttVars.
        
        Adjust command functions data parameter type to the union.  Since
        these are used outside init.c, relocate the union definition to
        mutt.h.
        
        Although the number of functions affected was long, most of them did
        not need much adjustment.  Many of them made no use of the parameter.
        Those that did were easily cast into an added "data" variable at the
        top.

        * Convert MuttVars.data and .init to use a union type.
        
        They were using an "unsigned long" and casting to a pointer when
        needed.  Obviously this has "worked" for a long time, but it's not
        correct to assume a pointer can fit in unsigned long.
        
        Replace with a union contain "void *p" and "long l".  Fortunately, the
        only parts making direct use of MuttVars are in init.h and init.c, so
        we just need to update those manipulation functions.

        * Remove mutt_rfc1524_expand_filename() return value and checks.
        
        The return value was of dubious value.  It returned 0 only for the
        case that a nametemplate was specified and it already matched the
        supplied oldfile.
        
        However, just because the nametemplate matched does not mean
        attachment handling in send-mode should skip the mutt_adv_mktemp()
        conversion, which includes a call to mutt_sanitize_filename().  We
        didn't do so if *no* nametemplate was supplied.
        
        Remove the return value from the function, and remove the checks and

        mutt_init() calls mutt_set_default() followed by

        mutt_str_replace(), which translates "" into 0.

        it's easy enough to have an account hook unset if needed, and I think
        a better idea that the user be forced to turn it off.

        * Fix compose and edit attachment symlink failure code.
        
        In the case where safe_symlink() fail, mutt prompts to continue, but
        did not properly reset the filename to be operated on.
        
        Fix up mutt_view_attachment() to use the same flow as the others, to
        allow for easier comparison.

        It will return this when a nametemplate entry already matched the

        already matching nametemplate entry to trigger.

        * Improve imap_append_message() error message handling.
        
        If the rc is IMAP_CMD_BAD, then either idata->buf is stale or an error
        message has already been printed (in cmd_handle_untagged()).
        
        Use imap_next_word() to skip over the next two words instead of
        directly skipping over SEQLEN, in case the buffer is in a different
        format.  We don't want to jump over the end of string.
        
        Skip the mutt_error() if there is nothing to print.

        * Enable the idata->check_status using bit operations.
        
        Commit e3f66d7e fixed dropped new mail notications, removing the
        unsetting of idata->reopen IMAP_NEWMAIL_PENDING in imap_cmd_finish()
        when an EXPUNGE was processed.
        
        However, imap_cmd_finish() can be called twice by
        imap_check_mailbox().  First as part of the imap_exec(), and manually
        again just below.
        
        Now that the IMAP_NEWMAIL_PENDING still exists, a second call could
        overwrite idata->check_status if both reopen flags were set.
        
        This unfortunately affects update_index(), which behaves differently
        for MUTT_REOPENED.
        
        I need to change the return value of mx_check_mailbox() in master to
        preserve all the bits, so the index can both notify of new mail and
        update_index() properly.
        
        For stable, the best fix is to use bit operators to enable the
        check_status flags in imap_cmd_finish() (and cmd_parse_fetch for
        flags), and keep the imap_check_mailbox() priority of setting its
        return value (it prioritizes IMAP_EXCHANGE_PENDING).

        * Improve robustness of imap_append_message().
        
        First, check the imap_cmd_step() return value instead of looking at
        idata->buf for "OK".  If the connection bombed and imap_cmd_step()
        returned IMAP_CMD_BAD, the value of idata->buf is stale.
        
        If the server returned "+ OK" for the command continuation request
        response, the call to imap_code(idata->buf) would even end up
        returning true, despite that the append failed!  (See #110, although
        at the time of commit I can only hypothesize this is what is
        happening.)
        
        Second, check the status of the writes.  flush_buffer() was not
        passing the rc from mutt_socket_write_n(), which was further making
        the above disaster scenerio possible.

2019-06-05 14:04:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us> (e3f66d7e)

        * Fix dropped new mail notifications when an EXPUNGE_PENDING is set.
        
        Prior to the fetch_headers rework and introduction of
        idata->max_msn (starting around e0376c75), cmd_handle_untagged() was
        looking directly at ctx->msgcount, which isn't fixed up until
        imap_expunge_mailbox().  At that time, more care had to be taken
        inbetween handling the EXPUNGE message and the actual expunge of the
        mailbox because of the discrepency between server state and mailbox
        context state.
        
        idata->max_msn is now decremented during the processing of EXPUNGE and
        VANISHED notices from the server, so reflect "current" state.  So,
        when we receive an EXISTS notice, we no longer need the checks for
        expunge state and can always set the NEWMAIL_PENDING flag.
        
        Additionally, fix imap_cmd_finish() to retain the IMAP_NEWMAIL_PENDING
        flag after handling an expunge.  The expunge does not grab new
        messages so dropping the flag would cause mutt to forget the new mail
        status until another EXISTS command.
        
        Since this is a stable branch fix, I'm leaving the either/or
        processing of expunge versus new mail in imap_cmd_finish().  However,
        I don't see why this has to be done in two calls.  I may rework that
        in master to process an expunge and then the new mail one after the
        other.

        * Remove FORCE prerequisite on version.h.
        
        This is causing package build issues on OpenBSD because of a
        difference in make behavior.
        
        In GNU make, it always invoke the 'version.h' target, but then checks
        to see if version.h changed before retriggering targets with that
        prerequisite.  On OpenBSD, invoking the version.h target always
        retriggers targets with that prerequisite.
        
        This means that updating the version information now requires a 'make
        clean' or manual removal of version.h.

        * Disable state messages for attachments when forwarding.
        
        First, option(OPTVIEWATTACH) is only set for (s->flags & DISPLAY), so that
        check can be ignored.
        
        With that removed, all this is doing is printing
          [-- This is an attachment ...]
        with no context in the middle of non-display rendering for the case
        $honor_disposition is set with a handler.
        
        This makes no sense and I believe is a logic error.  Perhaps this
        never took effect, but with $forward_attachments it now affects
        forwarding in that case.

        If $honor_disposition is set, an "attachment" disposition decodable
        attachment won't be included in the body, so we want it to be added as
        an attachment to the forwarded email.

        * Make mutt.texi and mutt.info generation continue on failure.
        
        Add warning messages, noting the appropriate packages to install.
        
        Note: mutt.texi won't normally be built unless configure finds one of
        the possible expected conversion program names.  Unfortunately, the
        canonical name, "docbook2texi", is used by both the docbook2x and
        docbook-utils projects.
        
        So on Arch, the canonical name is what we need, while on Debian and
        Red Hat/Fedora it isn't.  We search for the alternative names first,
        but it's still possible to invoke the wrong program if the needed
        package is not installed.

        * Add $forward_attachments quadoption for inline-forward mode.
        
        When set or answered yes, non text-decodable parts will be attached to
        the new message.  The default value is "ask-yes", because I believe
        this is something people will want to use, and should be made aware of
        the new possible behavior.
        
        The option presents a nice middle ground between previous
        inline-forwarding behavior (where all the non-text parts were
        dropped), and $mime_forward where the entire email was included as an
        attachment.
        
        This was previously difficult to achieve, but after the
        recv-attachment refactoring: (a19e5266^..faabd621)
        it became possible to use the ATTACH_CONTEXT and the recvattach.c
        helper mutt_generate_recvattach_list() to properly deal with nesting
        and multiple file-handles.

        This is the same behavior as the regular browser, but I think still

        LSUB is required to include mailboxes with subscribed children, but
        the just added "LIST (SUBSCRIBED)" by default does not do that.
        
        To match previous behavior, add RECURSIVEMATCH to make sure the
        children are included.  Fix the parser to trim off the CHILDINFO
        suffix in the response.

        * Improve hierarchy information accuracy in IMAP browser
        
        Currently the IMAP browser relies on LIST and LSUB (for listing subscribed
        folders) which may not provide the required hierarchy information.
        
        RFC3348 section 3 goes as far as stating that a client mustn't rely on LSUB
        for hierarchy information.
        
        This patch implements the LIST command extensions specified in RFC5258
        requiring that a server must respond with hierarchy information for
        listed folders (whether or not filtering on subscribed folders).

        * Add $imap_fetch_chunk_size to allow FETCHing new headers in chunks.
        
        For extremely large mailboxes, some implementations will time out just
        while fetching the new headers, because the client doesn't send any
        commands for 30 minutes while downloading the large number of headers.
        
        Rewrite imap_fetch_msn_seqset() to return chunks of size
        $imap_fetch_chunk_size.
        
        The change requires trusting the server will follow the RFC and not
        send an EXPUNGE during or between the FETCH chunks; otherwise we'll
        miss MSNs between the chunks because the shift.
        
        We could in theory continue to set "msn_begin = idata->max_msn + 1",
        but that makes the assumption there are no holes in the header cache
        that we are filling in during a chunk.  Personally I am dubious about
        "header cache holes", but the IMAP code has explicitly mentioned and
        handled them since prior to my involvement.
        
        Since the RFC forbids the interleaving EXPUNGE I believe it's safe
        enough to set "msn_begin = fetch_msn_end + 1" until proven otherwise.

        The "action-if-found" argument of AC_SEARCH_LIBS is run even if the
        result is "none required" (i.e. the test function is already in LIBS,
        in this case -lidn2).
        
        This was causing "-lunistring" to be appended on a system without the
        library installed, generating a build error.  Fix the test to not
        append the library for the "none required" case.

        The commit allowed the generation of illegal length header lines.  A
        correct fix needs to implement parameter continuations.
        
        I will work on that, but in case I don't get it in before 1.12,
        preserve the hard truncation.

        * Convert other users of BUFFY->pathbuf to use BUFFERS.
        
        A few functions in browser.c, buffy.c, and monitor.c were using
        BUFFY->pathbuf but were potentially truncating via fixed size buffers.
        Convert those to use BUFFERS too.
        
        buffy_get() was creating epath and expanding it, apparently to match
        against expanded BUFFY list entries, was wasn't using the epath.  I

        * Change IMAP to try oauthbearer first.
        
        $imap_authenticators says if it is unset, the authenticators from
        most-secure to secure will be tried.  It makes sense for oauthbearer
        to come first, like with POP.
        
        To make this change backwards compatible, it depends on the previous
        commit, which changed imap_auth_oauth() to return IMAP_AUTH_UNAVAIL if
        oauth is not configured or explictily requested.

        shouldn't abstract the buffer where we can.

        * Add $include_encrypted config to prevent reply-decryption attack.
        
        @jensvoid, in cooperation with Ruhr-Uni Bochum and FH Münster,
        Germany, reported a possible "Oracle decryption" attack on various
        mail clients.  An attacker could include previously encrypted contents
        they obtained access to, and include it in a message.  Replying
        without trimming would include the decrypted contents.
        
        This attack relies on several "ifs", and is more dangerous for clients
        that compose HTML mail.  However, it is still an issue that an
        unwary/busy Mutt user could fall for.
        
        Add a new config $include_encrytped, defaulting off, to reduce the
        possibility of the user being unaware of previously encrypted parts in
        the reply.  Only the main initial encrypted part will be included in
        the reply.

        * Fix truncation of long filenames in attachments.
        
        Currently mutt truncates long filenames in attachments and doesn't
        take into account UTF-8 character size. If filename is truncated in
        the middle of multi-byte UTF-8 character (last character is bad),
        then some mail clients assume whole attachment name bad and don't
        display its name (use 'Noname' instead).
        
        Filenames can be up to 255 *characters* long depending on used
        filesystem. ReiserFS, NFTS, FAT, APFS and some other supports up to
        255 characters.
        In the worst case 255 characters in UTF-8 will take 255*4 = 1020
        bytes. Every non-ascii byte in the filename will be encoded using 3
        bytes (for example, %8D).
        So 'Content-Disposition' will take in the worst case up to: 1020*3 =
        3060 bytes. Therefore even LONG_STRING (1024) isn't enough.

        * Allow descending into maildir and mh directories in file browser
        
        Some (maybe most) IMAP mail systems allow folders to be nested inside
        folders, so you can have, say, an Inbox with more folders inside it.
        However, in the file browser, mutt will only open a maildir/mh
        directory as a mailbox, there is no way to get to the child mailboxes.
        
        This change adds a function <descend-directory> that forces mutt to
        descend into the directory.  It is unbound by default.

        * Fix mkdtemp() random signedness
        
        time_t return of time() may be signed 32-bit and in that case
        probably will roll over in the year 2038 and yield a negative
        value; signedness was propagated in the XOR operation to the
        'value' and then 'v' variables. The 'v % 62' operation then would
        had resulted in a negative value and LETTER[v%62] would had
        accessed an arbitrary data location.
        
        The same could had happened if the static long 'value' variable
        after a very long run time contained a sufficiently large value to
        which the time^pid value added resulted in a wrap / roll-over to a
        negative value.
        
        Using unsigned long types for 'value' and 'v' and casting time_t
        to unsigned long cures all this.

        * Clean up code indentation.
        
        These are mostly automated changes corresponding to the emacs
        settings:
          (c-set-style "linux")
          (setq c-basic-offset 2)
          (c-set-offset 'case-label '+)
        
        Most of the code follows the convention:
          (add-to-list 'c-cleanup-list 'space-before-funcall)
        but this is not enforced by this indentation cleanup.
        
        Also, I personally dislike tabs, so I have:
          (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
        in my own configuration.  However I have no desire to change every line
        just for that effect.  So this cleanup does nothing about the mix issue.
        
        Some of the secondary files (e.g. regex.c) have been skipped.
        
        I've also skipped crypt-gpgme.c, because I need to think about that
        file.  Werner Koch and the GnuPG team contributed most it, and it
        follows the Gnu indentation settings.  It should probably be made
        uniform with Mutt, but I don't want to discourage future GnuPG
        contribution to the file.
        
        I manually reverted a few unsightly cleanups, and added a few tweeks
        when I saw things that could be improved.

        usability (searching/limiting/replying) when reopening a mailbox
        without header cache.  However, it is a security trade-off, so
        defaults off and strongly warns about what it is doing in the documentation.

        * Improve the console output for extract-keys and speed up import.
        
        The listing of imported keys to the console must have stopped working
        on 2014-12-31 due to a fix for bug #3698, commit
        bbc5acb6de0ca56d7e8366402d68a1a919ca9b23 which was needed due to a
        not fully working stub code introduced in 2008 with commit
        a4b3a60dd63bc7af7927025b2d1344530ca89aa9.
        
        The latter commit also introduced a bug in the import code which
        listed all keys in the keyring to a temporary file and copied that one
        to stdout.  The former commit avoided the output to stdout.
        
        The fix here is to use pgp_gpgme_extract_keys only for extracting
        information about the key and don't re-use the same code for importing
        keys.  We now import the keys directly in pgp_gpgme_invoke_import and
        we print the fingerprint and status flags for all imported keys.  That
        information available from GPGME for ages (0.3.1 from 2003).
        The user id is unfortunately not printed; that would require a lookup
        of the newly imported key.  Can be done with another patch.

2018-12-03 08:41:55 +0100  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org> (55c18b7e)

        * Try to avoid creation of temp. directory for key import.
        
        Since gpgme 1.9.0 it is possible to list keys directly from a file
        without importing it into gpg' own keyring.  This patch implements
        this in a backward compatible way.
        
        Unfortunately we need to check for a suitable gpgme version at build
        time and also for a suitable gpg version at runtime.  This is
        implemented by a version check which requires to call or include code
        taken from libgpg-error (aka gpgrt).  However this library is anyway a
        dependency of gpgme and thus does not pose any extra burden.
        
        The functions parse_version_number, parse_version_string, and
        cmp_version_strings are taken from libgpg-error's repo at 2018-11-20.
        Libgpg-error is distributed under the LGPL-2.1-or-later.

        * Always use the gpgme_new wrapper in crypt-gpgme.
        
        The wrapper is much more convenient and there is no need to sometimes
        use gpgme_new directly.  The perceived advantage on not bailing out in
        an out-of-core condition is not realistic because other small amounts
        of memory are allocated all over mutt anyway and thus function will
        terminate the process as well.
        
        This patch also changes the minimum version of gpgme to 1.4.0.  This
        is so that we can always pass NULL to functions like gpgme_release.
        Further 1.4.0 has new functions which we may soon like to use.

        GPGME 1.2.0 was released nearly 10 years ago and thus we can really
        demand this version.  For various reasons it would be advisable to
        require a decent version but that is a different thing and needs to be
        done in a separate patch.
        
        HAVE_GPGME_OP_EXPORT_KEYS and HAVE_GPGME_PKA_TRUST are not anymore
        needed because they are supported by that GPGME version.

        Some non-compliant MUAs split rfc2047 words inside a multibyte

        Deal with this by accumulating decoded words sharing the same

        Emails with extremely long lines, combined with a large number of

        to have hung.
        
        Switching out to using a binary search speeds things up noticably.
        
        The for loops being replaced were a bit strange.  resolve_types()
        ensures there are no overlaps, and that they are ordered.  A match is
        defined by (first <= cnt < last).  I can't see any reason for the
        strange comparison of (cnt > last) follow by (cnt != last).  Perhaps
        at one time it made sense.

        * Fix incorrect IMAP message purging bug.
        
        Thanks to Ivan Middleton @imiddle for the awesome bug report and
        suggested fix.
        
        The bug is most easily generated using Gmail with the $trash variable
        set.
        
        Deleted messages are first copied to the $trash folder.  If this is
        set to "[Gmail]/Trash", then Gmail inteprets the copy as a "delete"
        and sends EXPUNGE messages back for the messages.
        
        cmd_parse_expunge() and cmd_parse_vanished() set the hdr->index to
        INT_MAX, which subsequently an imap_expunge_mailbox() will use to
        remove the messages from the local mailbox.
        
        If we close the mailbox instead of sync it, Mutt will end up executing
        the 'Deleted' flag setting before processing the expunge (because
        "imap_check_mailbox() -> imap_cmd_finish()' doesn't set check_status
        when we are closing).  The expunged messages will then be included in
        the set of 'Deleted' flags.
        
        Unfortunately, because the messages are sorted by *index* before
        msgset generation, an incorrect range of UIDs will be sent, which
        could easily include messages that should not be deleted.
        
        This fix is a minimal fix for a stable bug fix  excluding
        messages with the index set to INT_MAX from all msg sets.  Other
        things that should be investigated in master are:
        
        - sorting by UID instead of index before msgset generation
        - unsetting the 'active' flag in cmd_parse_expunge() and
          cmd_parse_vanished() instead of waiting until imap_expunge_mailbox()
          to do so.

        * Show top-level decoded smime text/plain parts.
        
        Commit 331d9d5a attempted to fix a problem with an attachment having
        extension .p7m.  The attachment menu tried to decode and failed, and
        the part ended up being replaced by a bogus text/plain part.
        
        The problem is that crypt_smime_decrypt_mime() returns a text/plain
        part if the decode fails, meaning we can't distinguish failure from
        success in this case.
        
        As a compromise, only use a text/plain resulting from a single
        top-level application_smime part.  This will allow for the case of an
        text/plain encoded email, but won't end up hiding attachments that
        were not decoded.

        * Improve attachment menu for s/mime parts. (closes #113)
        
        Don't prompt for passphrase or getkeys, or set the ENCRYPT flag, for
        OPAQUE types.
        
        Don't recurse on "text" output from decrypt_mime().  There is no
        reason to recurse on a text type.  Additionally, the
        mutt_read_mime_header() will return an empty text type even if the
        decode doesn't generate mime output.  In those cases, we want to show
        the original attachment.

        * Fix tunnels to also retry and write full buffer.
        
        Change the tunnel_socket_read() and tunnel_socket_write() as the raw
        sockets were adjusted in the previous commit.  Retry on EINTR, and
        complete a full write so all the implementations have the same behavior.

        * Fix raw socket read/write to follow expected behavior.
        
        The mutt_sasl.c code expects conn_write() to write the entire buffer.
        This is inconsistent with mutt_socket.c, but since other conn_write()
        implementations guarantee this, change raw_socket_write() to do so too
        for now.
        
        Also, update reading and writing to loop on EINTR, as gnutls does.
        They won't return EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK because we don't mark sockets
        as non-blocking.

        The gitlab registry image is built using the Dockerfile in
        muttmua/docker-images/tree/master/ubuntu/18.04/
        
        Turn off the scan-build-5.0.  I never look at those reports and they
        run very slowly.
        
        Also, for now just compile for gnutls, to speed up the check further.

        * Fix gnutls tls_socket_write() to properly retry.
        
        Retry on GNUTLS_E_AGAIN and GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.  This prevents an
        aborted send due to a SIGWINCH, for instance.
        
        Change tls_socket_read() to follow the same flow.  Don't bother
        checking gnutls_error_is_fatal() because return codes besides AGAIN
        and INTERRUPTED end up closing the connection regardless.  (We don't
        handle handshakes and negotations during send/receive).

        It looks like LibreSSL does not perform automatic initialization of
        the library and error strings.
        
        Since LibreSSL defines OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER as a "version 2",
        add a check if LIBRESSL_VERSION_NUMBER is defined and call the
        initialization functions for that case.

        * Make a copy of x_label before encoding it for updates.
        
        This isn't actually a bug.  Context->label_hash strdups the keys, so
        we are safe from dangling references.  However, the subj_hash uses
        direct references, so to keep things consistent and safe, make a copy
        and encode that.

        GnuPG changed the format of their --with-colons output in 2.0.10.
        Dates are now seconds since epoch.  Update the parse_pub_line() code
        to detect the new format.
        
        The GnuPG changes also separated pub and the first uid.  Since mutt
        allows an empty uid field, the output is a bit less friendly now, with
        an initial key without an uid.  I think that's acceptable, but
        eventually we'll want to change the parsing behavior.

        When handling QRESYNC vanished, imap_expunge_mailbox() was called to
        empty out the messages.  Various counters, including vcount are
        updated by the mx_update_tables() after the expunge.
        
        These counters need to be reset, because mx_update_context() will do
        so once again at the end of reading new headers.  This can cause an
        out of bounds access in v2r.

        * Add a flag for dynamic date range evaluation in patterns.
        
        By default, Mutt evaluates relative date patterns, such as "~d<1d"
        against the date when the pattern is compiled.
        
        For index-format-hook, we need to pattern match against a message
        based on the current date/time, so that for example, conditional date
        format patterns correctly match after Mutt has been open for many
        days/weeks.
        
        Add a flag, MUTT_PATTERN_DYNAMIC, that changes ~d and ~r evaluation to
        reevaluate the min/max range with each match.
        
        This will of course be slower, but for the index, where a screenful of
        messages at a time are evaluated, is an acceptable tradeoff against
        accurate pattern matching.

        It can be used, for example, to implement date formatting based on the
        age of the message.
        
        Add a new %@name@ expando to $index_format, which evaluates the
        matching index-format-hooks with "name".

        * Fix memleaks of saslconn on error paths
        
        If mutt_sasl_client_new returns an error, the callers would ignore the
        allocated saslconn resource from sasl_client_new. Be sure to release
        these with sasl_dispose as documented in sasl.h. Likewise, let callers
        (POP/IMAP) dispose the resource on their error paths. SMTP was already
        taken care of. Found with LeakSanitizer in IMAP.

        * Ensure a resized empty buffer is null-terminated.
        
        The new buffer code is using the pool, which ensures its buffers are
        null-terminated.
        
        However, if a "new" buffer from another part of the code were passed
        to one of the temporary interfaces that resizes the buffer, it's
        possible a non-terminated string might end up being passed through.
        
        It's reasonable to expect mutt_b2s() for a "new" buffer should be the
        same as after it is resized larger.  So ensure the resulting buf->data
        is properly terminated to avoid surprises.

        Accept a saved cert at any point in the chain, except for those
        revoked or with invalid dates.
        
        The INSECUREALG processing was a bit goofed up.  It was skipping the
        prompt for every chain except the host, and was only displaying an
        error for entry 1 (the host being 0, root being len-1).  Instead
        prompt at any point, and display a warning as with the other errors.
        
        Add a CERTERR_OTHER type to capture other bits.  Recently GnuTLS has
        added additional certificate_status_t types.  We may want to improve
        the prompts in the future for those, but for now at least make sure
        it's recorded in certerr.

        For the case of SIGNERNOTCA, INSECUREALG, or a newer unhandled value,
        the "(a)ccept always" prompt was allowed, but the cert saving was
        prevented by a check only against NOTTRUSTED.  This ended up giving a
        strange error message saying the cert was not saved.
        
        Fix to save the cert for all errors except HOSTNAME (which is handled
        separately).

        Use to ensure assembled IMAP commands fit in the resultant buffer to
        be imap_exec()'ed.
        
        RFC2683 suggested a limit of 1000, but asked servers to accept up to
        8000.  Furthermore, RFC7162 bumped the client limit suggestion up to
        8192.  So I don't believe any issues will be caused by this.
        
        Most of these are increases are just to remove theoretical truncation
        warned about by the compiler; I don't believe we've had reports of
        actual command truncation due to a mailbox 1024 characters long.

        * Fix non-threaded $sort_aux "reverse-" sorting.
        
        The secondary sort was looking at (Sort & SORT_REVERSE) instead
        of (SortAux & SORT_REVERSE), so wasn't even performing the reverse
        based on the correct flag.
        
        Additionally, afterwards, the primary sort was improperly applying a
        reverse when the secondary sort returned non-zero.
        
        Change SORTCODE() to look at SortAux when we are inside a secondary
        sort.
        
        Change AUXSORT() to return the result if the secondary sort returns
        non-zero.  It is ugly to put a return inside the macro, but the check
        for non-zero needs to be performed inside the AUXSORT if branch.
        
        If the secondary sort returns 0, then the primary sort can still
        compare index and apply a reverse as needed.

        When viewing attachments externally with a (non-copiousoutput) mailcap

        attachment piped into stdin.  However, unlike a filter, the user
        interacts with the command, instead of just displaying the output in
        the pager.

        With the flag MUTT_IMAP_CONN_NONEW, it was already ensured the
        connection would be authenticated.  However, without that flag, an
        error in opening the connection or authentication would still return
        an idata.
        
        The callers that didn't bother to check the state were still assuming
        authenticated, because they were all subseqeuently issuing an
        "authenticated state" command to the server.
        
        Rather than add state checks to every caller, just change the function
        to return NULL if the idata did not end up in an authenticated state.

        This is a minor inconvenience for pgp2, pgp5, and pgp6 users, but I
        believe this constitutes an extremely small number of users at this
        point.
        
        I am keeping pgpewrap as-is because it is also used by GnuPG, and has
        no such naming conflict.

        * Remove extra lstats() in safe_rename() upon link success.
        
        I originally kept the lstat()'s in order to make as few changes as
        possible to the function.  However, Derek Martin argues correctly that
        if we are trusting the link() 0-retval, the lstats are unnecessary and
        in fact can cause a performance impact over NFS.

        * Add additional error handling to safe_rename().
        
        It is apparently possible for link() to return an error but the link
        to still be created.  Add a double check for that case.  If the files
        match, unlink the src and return success.

        * Display an error message if syncing fails.
        
        Ticket 36 reported an issue where a maildir was removed while the
        mailbox was opened.  Later, attempting to sync displayed the message
        "Writing xxx...", which remained on the screen.  The reporter actually
        thought mutt was frozen, but it was simply that on a sync error Mutt
        wasn't clearing or updating the message window.
        
        There is some error message handling for mbox.c check_mailbox, but I
        don't think that is the right place to further propogate messages.
        Instead, add an error to the same place the initial "Writing..."
        message is created.

        * Remove compare_stat() call in safe_rename().
        
        Some filesystems, such as sshfs, implement hard links strangely.  The
        hard link is created, but is represented by a different inode number
        by the sshfs layer.  The current maildir code goes into an infinite
        loop in this case.  Remove the compare_stat() and trust that a link()
        return code of 0 means the link really did get created.  Still, keep
        the stats just as a minor check.

        Once the mailbox is open, it is significantly more complicated to

        open/download Mutt is prepared to close the mailbox cleanly on
        failure.

        * Remove legacy trim_incomplete_mbyte() in the pager.
        
        Commit 4b1deb57 added the trim_incomplete_mbyte() call, but at
        that time, the function was using fgets() into a fixed-sized
        buffer.  The function was passing in "blen - 1" to the size
        parameter of fgets, so the check for blen-2 was to see if the
        buffer was completely filled by the fgets.
        
        Commit d39d9c0c converted to use a dynamic buffer, but the
        trim_incomplete_mbyte() was left in.  It now serves no purpose
        because the entire line will be read in.  Presumably the buggy
        regexp lib should have been fixed by now too.

        * Only sync CONDSTORE and QRESYNC on the initial download.
        
        In the midst of the imap_read_headers() refactor, I forgot to put this
        guard on the /MODSEQ and /UIDSEQSET storage.
        
        Because we don't deal with flag sync issues while the mailbox is open,
        or when it closes, we only want to write those values to the header
        cache during the initial download.
        
        It makes no sense to perform all the header cache work if new messages
        come into an open empty mailbox, so add a parameter to flag the
        initial download, rather than check for msn_begin==1.

        * Add basic CONDSTORE support when fetching initial messages.
        
        Store MODSEQ in the header cache, and use that to perform a "FETCH
        CHANGEDSINCE" for header updates when initially downloading messages.
        
        Further improvements could be made to add support when syncing.
        Handling MODSEQ for FLAG updates while the mailbox is open would be
        complicated by the fact that Mutt supports locally modified headers,
        so we couldn't accept the new (or subsequent) MODSEQ.
        
        However, this initial step may at least provide some benefit when
        opening the mailbox, which is generally the most time and data
        intensive.

        -Z did not work if $imap_passive was set (the default).  I think using
        the option implies the desire to open a new connection and check
        buffy at startup, so temporarily turn it off during the buffy.
        
        -z was not hooked up for IMAP.  Change it to call imap_status().  This
        also requires $imap_passive be unset, so temporarily turn the option
        off too.

        AUXSORT already checks if the first parameter is zero.
        
        Additionally, the macro expands into more than one statement, so
        putting inside an unbracketed if is misleading and generates a
        warning on the latest gcc.

        Mbox pads with a 1 byte, while mmdf pads with 10.  Because compress

        Callers of mx_sync_mailbox() and mx_close_mailbox() already check for

        There are many equivalent limit-to-all patterns, but in practice, one

        2. Limit the view.
        3. Set sort by date (thus unthreaded).
        4. Set $status_format to display the size of the messages shown (%L).
        5. Copy a message matching the limit pattern to this mailbox.
        6. With another Mutt instance, remove this message from this mailbox.
        7. Move the cursor to update the view.
        Result: one was getting a value equal to twice the initial size.

        * Display matching new messages in a thread-limited index.
        
        Previously, the index performed pattern matching first, and then
        resorted new mail.  The problem was that thread-limiting patterns,
        e.g. ~(pattern), require threading data to properly match against the
        new messages.
        
        We already save new messages for the purposes of uncollapsing threads.
        To keep the code cleaner, split off update_index() into
        update_index_threaded()/unthreaded().  Then for threaded mode, save
        the new messages first.  We can then sort (before pattern matching),
        and use the save_new array to pattern match the new messages
        afterwards.
        
        The $uncollapse_new loop was unnecessarily performing a n^2 search.
        Simplify to just iteratate over the save_new instead.

        Reset both the descriptor and changed flag when the current context is
        removed.  Don't make this dependent on the context being valid or

        Reset the context descriptor before checking for the monitor being
        shared by another mailbox.  Technically, it would be set properly
        during the next add, but it shouldn't be left incorrect.

        * Work around open mailbox monitor code check issue.
        
        The monitor code is too fast, and can result in all the changes for a
        single directory stat update being missed.
        
        Work around this issue by not recording stat time updates when the
        check_mailbox() is triggered by the monitor.  This will cause the next
        subsequent check to take another look.

        miss the resulting problem in the documentation.
        
        Credit goes to Eike Rathke for noting that it was too easy to forget
        to do this, and something should be fixed.  I found his solution a bit
        too complicated though, and opted for just adding comment and program
        failure.

        This came up in the comp.mail.mutt newsgroup where a user wasn't
        satisfied with the SHORT_MAX seconds ~9 hours limit on passphrase
        timeouts.
        
        For the first time made it necessary for the options parser to be
        able to parse numbers as long values. Also, introduced
        mutt_add_timeout() to detect possible overflow before adding a
        timeout to a time_t value and truncate to TIME_T_MAX instead.

        * Convert context and buffy to use nanosecond timestamps.
        
        The inotify interface has an unfortunate side effect of making Mutt
        react too quickly to new mail.  Sometimes, the mail is only
        half-delivered when the mailbox is checked.  Because Mutt is using the
        stat mtime - seconds resolution - this means it won't realize there
        are more messages delivered during the same second.
        
        Nanosecond resolution fields were standardized in POSIX.1-2008, so
        check for and use those if they are available.

        * Support for using OAUTHBEARER for smtp.

        * Initial support for OAUTHBEARER for IMAP.
        
        Gmail supports RFC 7628 for using OAUTH with IMAP, and they really don't
        like you using password based auth.  You can still enable "less secure
        apps" and then generate an application specific password, but I figured it
        was time to support it.
        
        Being mutt, I punted on some of the "hard" work to an external script, ie
        getting/refreshing the OAUTH tokens.  This avoids the issue of how do you
        have a client-id and client-secret for an open source project, and the fact
        that OAUTH discovery is still nascent, so you'd likely need separate things
        for each of the providers.
        
        At least for Gmail, you can use the oauth2.py script from Google's
        gmail-oauth2-tools:
        https://github.com/google/gmail-oauth2-tools/blob/master/python/oauth2.py
        
        You'd need to get your own oauth client credentials for Gmail here:
        https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials
        
        Then, you'd use oauth2.py with --generate_oauth2_token to get a refresh
        token, and configure mutt with:
        
        set imap_authenticators="oauthbearer"
        set imap_user="<email_address>"
        set imap_pass=`/path/to/oauth2.py --quiet --user=<email_address>
        --client_id=<client_id> --client_secret=<client_secret>
        --refresh_token=<refresh_token>`
        
        For this patch, I didn't add any new configuration, but I'm open to
        suggestions on that.
        
        The patch also only support SASL-IR to reduce round-trips to the server,
        but it's certainly possible to change that if we think there are
        OAUTHBEARER IMAP servers that don't support SASL-IR.  It also requires the
        connection to be encrypted as the access token is re-usable for an hour or
        so.  Again, Gmail only allows encrypted IMAP connections, not sure if any
        OAUTHBEARER services allow non-encrypted.
        
        Turns out that auth failure leaves you in SASL mode, so I have a hack to
        issue a noop command on error.  Not sure if that's just OAUTHBEARER
        oddness, or whether I should be using lower level mutt imap functions.

        Change monitor.c to reference the curs_lib value, instead of

        We need to store the value for both monitor.c's poll and for

        Ncurses does its own buffering for some character sequences, notable

        performing the mutt_monitor_poll() call.

        The ncurses timeout() function doesn't affect the new poll inside
        mutt_monitor_poll().  This meant that $imap_keepalive and $timeout
        were not being respected when the monitor was used.
        
        Create mutt_getch_timeout(), which delegates to timeout() and sets a
        timeout value mutt_monitor_poll() uses too.

        The inotify handler now returns -2 (timeout) on a new mail event.

        aborted.
        
        Also, fix mutt_change_flag() to call mutt_refresh() before the
        prompt.  Apparently ncurses getch() was doing this for us, but now
        that we are polling STDIN instead, the prompt wasn't displaying.

        Thanks to Fabian Groffen for pointing out the discrepancy.
        
        mutt_extract_token() null-terminates the token,, so actually there is
        no need to use "strncmp" for the comparison in this case.
        
        However, since the token is being checked against Fields there is no
        potential harm of a prefix match, so we should fix the number to be
        consistent with the other token comparisons.

        When handling automatic subscription (via $imap_check_subscribed), or

        command but failed to properly escape backquotes.

        * Add GnuPG status fd checks for inline pgp.
        
        The difficulty is that "BEGIN PGP MESSAGE" could be a signed and
        armored part, so we can't fail hard if it isn't encrypted.
        
        Change pgp_check_decryption_okay() to return more status codes, with
        >=0 indicating an actual decryption; -2 and -1 indicating plaintext
        found; and -3 indicating an actual DECRYPTION_FAILED status code seen.
        
        Fail hard on -3, but change the message for -2 and -1 to indicate the
        message was not encrypted.

        If set (the default) mutt performs more thorough checking of the
        $pgp_decrypt_command status output for GnuPG result codes.
        
        Ticket #39 revealed that GnuPG (currently) does not protect against
        messages that have been manipulated to contain an empty encryption
        packet followed by a plaintext packet.
        
        A huge thanks to Marcus Brinkmann for researching this issue, taking
        the time to report it to us (and the GnuPG team), and taking even more
        time to clarify exactly what needed to be checked for.

        For now, I've decided to include mutt_message() messages too.  If this

        * Add $browser_abbreviate_mailboxes.
        
        This allows '=' and '~' mailboxes shortcuts to be turned off in the
        browser mailbox list.
        
        The default $sort_browser value of "alpha" uses strcoll(3), which
        ignores some punctuation.  When using multiple accounts with
        dynamically changing values of $folder, this can lead to an
        unintuitive sorting order.  (See issue #22 for an example.)
        
        This problem came about because of commit 8328ce68, which enabled
        mutt_pretty_mailbox() calls for IMAP and POP mailboxes too.  The
        commit had a valid point about consistency and too-wide mailbox
        listings, so I don't really want to revert it.
        
        This option provides an alternative to completely enable/disable the
        shortcuts for those who run into an issue.

        Like the pass field in commit 52949004, the existing size was

        pgp_extract_keys_from_messages() has been subsumed by

        PGPENCRYPT, PGPKEY, SMIMEENCRYPT, and SMIMEOPAQUE are all combination
        flags, with multiple bits set.  In a few places these flags were
        bitwise-and'ed incorrectly: expecting a non-zero result to indicate
        all the bits in the flag were set.  Change those to explicitly compare
        the result against the original flag.

        * Create pgp and s/mime default and sign_as key vars. (see #3983)
        
        The $postpone_encrypt and $(pgp/smime)_self_encrypt configuration
        variables have created a somewhat messier situation for users.  Many
        of them now have to specify their keys across multiple configuration
        variables.
        
        (Trac) Ticket #3983 had a reasonable request: "if my encrypt and
        signing keys are the same, why can't I just specify my key once in my
        .muttrc?"
        
        The problem currently is that $smime_default_key and $pgp_sign_as are
        both used to specify signing keys, and are set by the "sign (a)s"
        security menu choice.  So we can't store encryption keys there because
        some users have separate sign-only capability keys.
        
        Create $pgp_default_key to store the default encryption key.  Change
        signing to use $pgp_default_key, unless overridden by $pgp_sign_as.
        The pgp "sign (a)s" will continue setting $pgp_sign_as.
        
        Create $smime_sign_as.  Change signing to use $smime_default_key
        unless overridden by $smime_sign_as.  Change s/mime "sign (a)s" menu
        to set $smime_sign_as instead.
        
        Change $postpone_encrypt and $(pgp/smime)_self_encrypt to use
        $(pgp/smime)_default_key by default.
        
        Mark $(pgp/smime)_self_encrypt_as deprecated.  They are now aliases
        for the $(pgp/smime)_default_key config vars.
        
        Change $(pgp/smime)_self_encrypt default to set.
        
        The intent is that most users now need only set
        $(pgp/smime)_default_key.  If they have a sign-only key, or have
        separate signing and encryption keys, they can put that in
        $(pgp/smime)_sign_as.  This also enables to default self_encrypt on
        and solve a very common request.
        
        Thanks to Michele Marcionelli and Vincent Lefèvre for gently pushing
        me towards a solution.

        * Disable message security if the backend is not available.
        
        Gitlab issue #3 exposed an awkward corner case: if mutt is configured
        without PGP or S/MIME, and with GPGME, but $crypt_use_gpgme is unset.
        In this case, no backend will be available, but WithCrypto will be set
        with both APPLICATION_PGP and APPLICATION_SMIME bits.
        
        That will allow various config vars to enable encryption or signing,
        even though there will be no backend available to perform them.  The
        message security flag might then be set, but when the user hits send,
        will end up back at the compose menu due to the error.
        
        The pgp or smime menu might not even be available to clear the
        security setting!
        
        Add a check in send.c before the compose menu is invoked, and give a
        warning message for the menu ops inside the compose menu.
        
        I believe this should prevent the issue.  However this is a corner
        case combined with user misconfiguration, so I don't believe is worth
        a large effort to completely eradicate.

        The only common use of atime left is local mail agents leaving a mark on

        * Enable full address matching during message scoring. (closes #2179) (see #3243)
        
        The tickets are old, but it seems reasonable to expect the pattern
        matching to behave the same in scoring as when applying limits or
        searching.
        
        I don't foresee a huge performance hit, and there are no arguments
        against the change in the tickets.
        
        Thanks to the muttng devs (noted in ticket 2179) and Kornilios Kourtis
        (from the Debian ticket referenced in ticket 3243).

        * Fix ansi escape sequences with both reset and color parameters. (closes #3689)
        
        The initial 0 "reset/normal" was setting attr = ANSI_OFF, which was
        subsequently being or'ed with ANSI_COLOR.
        
        The color resolution was then checking for the ANSI_OFF bit and
        turning all coloring off, even though ANSI_COLOR was also set.
        
        Change the color resolution to check for "attr == ANSI_OFF" instead, so
        the color isn't reset unless the reset occurs last in the sequence.

        Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for noticing the nested else was redundant,
        since buf_ptr is already set to "buf + cnt" after the format_line()
        call.
        
        This allows us to merge the inner and outer if statement, resulting in
        simpler code.

        * Fix $smart_wrap to not be disabled by whitespace-prefixed lines. (closes #3857)
        
        changeset:737102af74eb fixed a folded header display issue with $smart_wrap
        by disabling $smart_wrap for lines beginning with whitespace.
        
        Unfortunately, this turns off smart wrapping in the body of an email
        too, even when the line has other whitespace breaks in it.
        
        An earlier commit, changeset:125076e0fdfa added an infinite loop fix
        when MUTT_PAGER_NSKIP is set, by disabling the smart_wrap if the space
        backtracking went to the beginning of the line.  That is, a line
        beginning with 1+ whitespace followed by a single long word.
        
        Extend this second commit by always disabling the smart_wrap in that
        case, not just when MUTT_PAGER_NSKIP is set.  This also solves the
        folded header issue without other side effects.

        * Add $change_folder_next option to control mailbox suggestion order.
        
        This patch is out of the Gentoo package maintained by Fabian Groffen.
        From the link below, it appears the original author was Simon Burge.
        
        I made some minor changes to get it to apply correctly, and cleaned up
        the documentation a bit.
        
        Original patch description:
        This patch brings back the original behaviour of change-folder, which
        some people find more useful.  It suggests the next folder in your
        mailboxes list that has new mail measured from the current folder,
        instead of the first folder from your mailboxes list in any case.  This
        prevents starvation of folders defined at the back of your list ;)

        * Use fgets_unlocked and fgetc_unlocked if available.
        
        Since mutt does not use threads, there is no reason it should use the
        locked variants of the FILE* IO functions. This checks if the unlocked
        functions are available, and if so enables them globally via mutt.h.
        
        Cuts load time for a 56k message, 1.8GB /var/mail mailbox from 14
        seconds to ~6 seconds, since we avoid acquiring and releasing a mutex

        * Enable $reply_self for group-reply, even with $metoo unset.
        
        For a (r)eply, the $metoo variable does not have any effect because
        there is a single recipient.
        
        However with (g)roup reply, the To was initially set to the sender,
        but subsequently removed my $nometoo.  The empty To line is then
        replaced with the Cc line, resulting in a (logically correct but)
        surprising outcome.
        
        Change the behavior such that $nometoo will not strip a single To
        recipient when $reply_self is set.

        * Make cmd_parse_fetch() more precise about setting reopen/check flags.
        
        Previously any FETCH with FLAGS would result in either
          idata->reopen |= IMAP_EXPUNGE_PENDING;
          -or-
          idata->check_status = IMAP_FLAGS_PENDING;
        being set.
        
        This is unnecessary in the case of responses to FLAGS.SILENT updates
        sent by mutt (which seem to commonly happen now-a-days).
        
        Change imap_set_flags() to compare the old server flags against the
        new ones, and report when _those_ updates would/did result in a local
        header flag change.  Only set one of the reopen/check_status flags in
        the event of an actual change (or potential change if a local change
        has been made to the header.)

        The reporter noted that when trying to use inline signing with
        format=flowed, the flowed was turned off.
        
        After some research, this appears to be deliberate, probably because
        of strange interactions between inline PGP and format=flowed.  In fact
        the RFC strongly discourages their combined use:
        https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3676#section-4.6

        Commit f52ee2f7 ensured the debug strings were properly '\0'

        the end of the status_string.value data; it simply capped it
        afterwards.  Improve the code so it only reads up to
        status_string.length without overwriting the buffer.

        * Rename _regex.h to _mutt_regex.h to avoid name collision on Macs.
        
        On Macs, <regex.h> includes <_regex.h>.  Because Mutt defines '-I .'
        during compilation, our bundled version of _regex.h was being used
        instead of the system one.
        
        I have no idea how it managed to work before, but starting in Xcode
        9.3, the differences in struct size and fields started to produce a
        crash and other strange behavior.
        
        The real issue is our use of '-I .' during compilation, which allows
        our local headers to override system ones.  An easier fix for now is
        to rename the header.
        
        Many thanks to Charles Diza, Christian Ebert, and Fabian Groffen for
        their help trying things out and helping to debug the problem.

        This fix is based on stbuehler's patch from

        Recent versions of gpgme seem to terminate the connection for a

        * Fix is_from() year parsing to abort on year overflow.
        
        Unlike mutt_parse_date(), is_from() was not checking for overflow, and
        could end up passing a negative year to mutt_mktime().
        
        It should perhaps be changed to use mutt_atoi(), which does better
        range checking, but that requires mutt_atoi() being changed to allow
        trailing characters and its callers return value checks being
        updated.  I'll put that on the todo list.

        * Cap parsed years at 9999 when converting to time_t.
        
        Large year values, even those less than INT_MAX, apparently can cause
        gmtime() and localtime() to return NULL.  Mutt needs larger changes
        checking and handling those errors, but this will prevent the

        * Fix imap status count range check.
        
        The strtoul() call for parsing the STATUS count wasn't checking the
        range properly, because it was assigning to an unsigned int.
        
        Change to assign to a unsigned long, and also add the conversion check
        from mutt_atoui().

        * Change imap literal counts to parse and store unsigned ints.
        
        IMAP literals are of type number.  Change imap_get_literal_count() to
        use mutt_atoui() instead of atoi().  Change the return type variables
        used to store the count to type unsigned int.
        
        It's doubtful this was a real issue, but as long as we're cleaning up
        incorrect atoi() usage, we should fix this too.

        * Fix improper signed int conversion of IMAP uid and msn values.
        
        Several places in the imap code, when parsing "number" and "nz-number"
        values from the IMAP data, use atoi() and strtol().  This is
        incorrect, and can result in failures when a uid value happens to be
        larger than 2^31.
        
        Create a helper function, mutt_atoui() and use that instead.  One
        place was using strtol() and relying on the endptr parameter, and so
        was changed to use strtoul() instead.
        
        Thanks to Paul Saunders for the bug report and original patch, which
        this commit is based on.

        * Fix s/mime certificate deletion bug. (closes #3982)
        
        Commit c1bcf4ba exposed a bug in the s/mime encryption code.  It was
        errorneously calling unlink on the list of generated cert files to
        use.
        
        Prior to that commit, the list had an initial space, which apparently
        made the unlink fail.  After that commit, encrypting to a single
        certificate would end up deleting the certificate.
        
        Remove the calls to unlink the cert file.  Add some missing cleanup if
        the call to openssl fails.

        The exact-address handling for comma and colon are different because

        The semicolon needs to be inside the address->val field of the address

        * Fix uses of context->changed as a counter.
        
        The first was in mx_update_tables(), but only when "not committing".
        This is used by mh/maildir during an "occult" update, and in imap when
        expunging the mailbox.  It meant to simply turn on changed when a
        single changed header is seen.
        
        The second use was in imap_sync_message_for_copy().  Previously this
        was used for a server side copy/save, but is now also used for
        fast-trash copying.  Remove the code that was trying to decrement the
        counter: this function is not capable of properly setting a status
        bit.

	* imap/imap.c: Add missing IMAP_CMD_POLL flag in imap buffy check.

	I missed adding the flag to one of the imap_exec() calls inside the
	loop, when a different server is encountered in the mailboxes list.

2017-09-22 11:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9e53c623d102)

	* imap/command.c: Close the imap socket for the selected mailbox on
	error.

	The new $imap_poll_timeout calls the cmd_handle_fatal() error
	handler on timeout, which is supposed to close and cleanup.

	However, for the currently selected mailbox, the error handler was
	not closing the socket after closing up the mailbox. This left extra
	SSL/GnuTLS data around and was causing errors on an attempt to
	reconnect.

	Thanks to Fabian Groffen for reporting the issue.

2017-09-22 11:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7155392ed28b)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix imap sync segfault due to inactive headers during
	an expunge. (closes #3971)

	Mutt has several places where it turns off h->active as a hack. For
	example to avoid FLAG updates, or to exclude from imap_exec_msgset.

	Unfortunately, when a reopen is allowed and the IMAP_EXPUNGE_PENDING
	flag becomes set (e.g. a flag update to a modified header),
	imap_expunge_mailbox() will be called by imap_cmd_finish().

	The mx_update_tables() would free and remove these "inactive"
	headers, despite that an EXPUNGE was not received for them. This
	would result in memory leaks and segfaults due to dangling pointers
	in the msn_index and uid_hash.

	There should probably be a more elegant solution, removing the
	initial hacks. However, this is causing a segfault, and the best
	solution right now is to turn active back on for non-expunged
	messages in imap_expunge_mailbox().

	Extra thanks to chdiza, who bravely runs tip and found this issue
	quickly.

2017-09-14 12:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (12d3714d8bfa)

	* imap/command.c, imap/message.c: Improve imap fetch handler to accept
	an initial UID. (closes #3969)

	Gmail sends flag updates with a UID before the FLAGS. The handler
	was very simple, and so ignored the flag update in that case.

	Pull the code from msg_parse_fetch(), paring down to just UID and
	FLAGS. This will handle arbitrary order data items.

2017-09-13 15:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f90712538cd9)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Change imap
	copy/save and trash to sync flags, excluding deleted. (closes #3966)
	(closes #3860)

	imap_copy_messages() uses a helper to sync the flags before
	performing a server-side copy. However, it had a bug that the
	"deleted" flag on a local message, if set, will be propagated to the
	copy too.

	Change the copy sync helper to ignore the deleted flag. Then, change
	the imap trash function to use the same helper.

	Thanks to Anton Lindqvist for his excellent bug report, suggested
	fixes, and help testing.

2017-09-13 15:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (19597bb7baa6)

	* imap/imap.c: Remove \Seen flag setting for imap trash. (see #3966)
	(see #3860)

	Commit 323e3d6e5e4c has a side effect where spurious FETCH flag
	updates after setting the \Seen flag can cause a sync to abort.

	Remove manually setting \Seen for all trashed message before
	copying.

	The next commit will change the imap trash function to use the same
	code as the imap copy/save function for syncing the message before
	server-side copying.

	is found, parent_hdr is set to the passed in hdr. In that case,
	parent will still be NULL, but parent_hdr and parent_fp will be set.

	Change the test to parent_hdr being NULL, not parent, to check for
	this case.

	* commands.c, protos.h, recvattach.c: Add edit-content-type helper and
	warning for decrypted attachments. (closes #3728)

	Regenerating the actx index will overwrite any changes made to a
	decrypted attachment. Change the mutt_edit_content_type() function
	to return 1 when a structural change is made. Add a warning message
	when that is the case and a decrypted message was edited, so the
	user is not surprised.

	Note: mutt_edit_content_type() appeared to regenerate multipart
	subparts every time, leading to a memory leak. I believe this was an
	oversite, and it should have regenerated only when there were no
	subparts, so have "fixed" this.

	pgp-gpgme.c, crypt-mod.h, cryptglue.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c,
	recvattach.c: Fix attachment check_traditional and extract_keys
	operations. (see #3728)

	Add helpers and iterate over the actx->idx instead of the BODY
	structure.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e6e8b2f1fae3)

	* attach.h, compose.c, pager.c, recvattach.c, recvcmd.c: Fix shared
	attachment functions. (see #3728)

	With nested decryption, the correct FP is associated with the
	ATTACHPTR entry. Also, the BODY entries are not continguous, so the
	functions need to iterate over the actx index, not the BODY
	structure.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (26e06bd4f29d)

	* recvattach.c: Fix the expand/collapse code to use the virtual index.
	(see #3728)

	Fix the init code to respect OPTDIGESTCOLLAPSE.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c7fe290bc3a3)

	* attach.c, attach.h, compose.c, recvattach.c: Add virtual index to
	actx. (see #3728)

	The virtual index is modeled after the CONTEXT. Add a CURATTACH
	helper to reduce code verbosity. Store the actx as menu->data.

	Simplify and consolidate the recvattach and compose menu update code
	inside a function.

	Because compose and recvattach share so much code, change compose to
	use the virtual index even though it has no collapse/expand
	functionality.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (23ce88ed8961)

	* attach.c, attach.h, compose.c, protos.h, recvattach.c: Change
	recvattach to allow nested encryption. (see #3728)

	* Add a FP and BODY array to the actx. These are used to allow
	proper cleanup.

	* Add HEADER and root_fp entries, to allow for index regeneration.

	* Separate out the compose and recvattach index generation
	functions.

	* Change the recvattach index generator to decrypt as encrypted
	parts are found.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ee1fd4a71a8a)

	* attach.c, attach.h, compose.c, recvattach.c: Add helpers to add and
	remove actx entries. (see #3728)

	Use the helper in compose update_idx(), to consolidate the resize
	logic and simplify the code.

	Separate out the actx "free" routine from a routine to empty out the
	idx. The index regeneration routines should flush and rebuild the
	index without having to renerate the actx structure.

	* attach.c, attach.h, browser.c, compose.c, pager.c, pager.h,
	recvattach.c, recvcmd.c: Change helpers functions to pass actx. (see
	#3728)

	Change the pager, compose, recvattach and recvcmd to pass the actx
	instead of the individual idx and idxlen parameters.

	Separate out the compose menu exit logic to first free the BODY data
	and then call the shared actx free function at the bottom.

2017-08-10 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (278b6efc6bba)

	* attach.c, attach.h, compose.c, recvattach.c: Create ATTACH_CONTEXT
	to hold attachment index. (see #3728)

	Move the idx and idxlen into ATTACH_CONTEXT. In subsequence patches,
	this structure will hold more useful items, such as the virtual
	index.

	The swap out is straightforward, except for:
	  * update_idx() in compose.c, which post-increments the idxlen in the
	call and again in the function.
	  * mutt_gen_attach_list() which doesn't need to returns the new values.

	* configure.ac, mutt_socket.c: Convert raw_socket_poll() to use
	gettimeofday().

	As long as gettimeofday() is supported, it's better to be consistent
	within mutt and ensure greater portability.

	Change the raw_socket_poll() wait timer to count milliseconds, like
	the mutt_progess_update() code.

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for his, as always, invaluable advice.

	* configure.ac, mutt_socket.c: Add autoconf search for clock_gettime.

	It appears to be specified in POSIX.1-2001, so just abort if it's
	not found.

	Add a missing time.h include in mutt_socket.c

2017-07-22 19:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4a1390537a29)

	* globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, init.h:
	Add $imap_poll_timeout to allow mailbox polling to time out.

	Enable the polling flag for the NOOP in imap_check_mailbox(), the
	STATUS command in imap_buffy_check(), and the LOGOUT command.

	This is not intended to handle all blocking-IO related issues.
	However, the periodic NOOP and STATUS are the most frequent places
	for mutt to freeze up, especially after a laptop is sleep/woken.

	Since these are quick operations with little data, this is a good
	place to check if the connection is still working before hanging on
	a read.

2017-07-22 19:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (908bea74acef)

	* imap/imap.c, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_sasl.h, mutt_socket.c, mutt_socket.h,
	mutt_tunnel.c: Add timeout parameter to mutt_socket_poll.

	This will be used in the next commit to add a timeout when polling
	for new mail.

2017-07-20 17:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a533c22715c8)

	* mutt.h, sendlib.c: When guessing an attachment type, don't allow
	text/plain if there is a null character. (see #2933)

	Type text/plain should not contain any null characters. Slightly
	improve the type guesser by forcing an attachment with any null
	characters to be application/octet-stream.

	Note the type guesser could use much more improvement, but this is
	an easy and obvious fix.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, menu.c: merge stable

2017-07-19 14:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (78cc40b6ba9e)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Change imap_cmd_start() to return OK
	when the cmd_queue is finished. (closes #3956)

	Some response handlers can end up recursively calling
	imap_cmd_start(), processing all the command completions. If the
	outer call was an imap_exec(), this would result in the loop never
	being terminated (or just blocking reading a server that has already
	finished all the commands).

	Change the callers that are simply using it to read a response,
	without having called cmd_start(), to check for IMAP_CMD_OK instead.
	Currently this is just the open connection function.

2017-07-19 14:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cf98f5d606a3)

	* menu.c: Fix menu color calls to occur before positioning the cursor.
	(see #3956)

	It is possible for menu->color() to end up fetching an imap message,
	and therefore generating a status message.

	Because of this, we need to make those calls before we position the
	cursor.

2017-07-14 15:19 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c4e507003aa0)

	* regex.c: Decrease regex failure stack limit. (closes #3955)

	When using alloca(), the built-in regexp library limited the failure
	stack to 20,000 entries. This value is too large, and causes
	alloca() to segfault in the example provided in the ticket.

	Decrease the limit to 8000.

	Thanks to Thorsten Wißmann for the excellent bug report, which made
	debugging this much easier.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix crash when $postponed is on another server.

	imap_mxcmp() translates NULL to "INBOX". When $postponed points to a
	URL with an empty or "INBOX" path, this will end up matching against
	a NULL idata->mailbox in imap_status(). This resulted in a crash
	because idata->ctx is also NULL.

	Thanks to Olaf Hering for the detailed bug report and suggested fix.

	* init.h: Minor documentation fixes.

	The muttrc man page doesn't contain the "Format Strings" section in

	$status_format.

2017-06-20 15:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (219b9064cf28)

	* mutt_socket.c: Block SIGWINCH during connect(). (closes #3941)

	FreeBSD's connect() does not respect SA_RESTART, so a SIGWINCH will
	end up interrupting the connect.

	If this code is needed in other places, it should be moved into
	signal.c. For this one place, inlining the sigprocmask() seemed
	okay.

2017-06-18 10:58 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d56fd3f91de9)

2017-06-14 15:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e8368cedbd95)

	* compose.c, init.h, send.c: Enable all header fields in the compose
	menu to be translated.

	While it is suggested they need not be, for some locales it might be
	preferable to be able to localize the fields.

	For instance, fr_FR may want to change the punctuation to have a
	space in front of the colon. ja_JP may be more comfortable with a
	native character set description of the field when using it every
	day.

2017-06-12 18:29 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (0e3730ed2c3c)

	* sendlib.c: Force hard redraw after $sendmail instead of calling
	mutt_endwin. (closes #3952) (see #3948)

	Adding a mutt_endwin() seemed like a clean solution to allowing
	ncurses pinentry for $sendmail, but it leaves other users watching a
	blank screen. This change is extremely likely to generate a large
	number of complaints and bug reports. So instead, force a hard
	refresh afterwards.

2017-06-12 17:57 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (26cbf2cac701)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Make GPGME key selection behavior the same as
	classic-PGP. (see #3950)

	Classic-PGP key selection auto-selected a match if there was a
	single strong, valid, address-match result, even if there were other
	weak matches.

	GPGME was prompting in the same situation, if there were other weak
	matches.

	Change GPGME to match the classic behavior, as this is more useful
	and matches the manual description.

2017-06-09 11:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4d0bb558636)

	* compose.c: Change the compose menu fields to be dynamically padded.

	Pad based on the maximum width of the fields. Note that this is a
	bit of a mess, because some of the fields are translated while
	others are not.

2017-06-08 13:26 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (966f08249216)

	* init.c, pgp.c: Backout 02ff4277259e (see #3948)

	Vincent expressed some legitimate concerns about exporting this to
	all programs lauched by mutt. The user can always set GPG_TTY in
	their .bashrc if needed for $sendmail. cf90bf5989f3 should resolve
	the refresh issue.

2017-06-06 18:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cf90bf5989f3)

	* sendlib.c: Add a mutt_endwin() before invoking $sendmail. (closes
	#3948)

	This is to support invoking a program such as msmtp that can use gpg
	to decrypt a password. The ncurses pinentry can corrupt the screen
	unless we exit curses.

2017-06-06 18:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (02ff4277259e)

	* init.c, pgp.c: Move setting of GPG_TTY to mutt_init(). (see #3948)

	This allows other programs mutt runs to use the ncurses pinentry if
	needed.

	* curs_main.c, menu.c: Fix tag-prefix to not abort on $timeout.

	If $timeout is set very low, then it can cancel the tag-prefix
	before the user has time to press the desired command.

	Change the code to set the tag flag, and then recontinue with normal
	event processing instead. Cancel on an abort, but continue with a
	timeout.

	Thanks to Lauri Tirkkonen for reporting the issue.

	* curs_main.c, enter.c, keymap.c, menu.c, pager.c: Change km_dokey()
	to return -2 on a timeout/sigwinch.

	In some cases, such as tag-prefix or _mutt_enter_string(), it is
	desirable to be able to distinguish between a timeout/sigwinch event

	* ChangeLog, UPDATING, VERSION: automatic post-release commit for
	mutt-1.8.3

2017-05-29 11:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (228364e8abb7)

	* init.h, send.c: Change $postpone_encrypt to use self-encrypt
	variables first.

	The concept of postpone encryption is similar to self-encrypting on
	send. The problem is the $postpone_encrypt_as option doesn't take
	into account whether PGP or S/MIME is being used.

	Since we need to add the new options for self-encryption, modify
	$postpone_encrypt to use them by default instead, falling back to
	$postpone_encrypt_as if they are unset. Note $postpone_encrypt_as is
	deprecated in the documentation.

2017-05-29 11:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ca95f3e38355)

	* crypt.c, globals.h, init.h, mutt.h: Add self-encrypt options for PGP
	and S/MIME.

	Add $pgp_self_encrypt, $pgp_self_encrypt_as, $smime_self_encrypt,
	$smime_self_encrypt_as.

	$pgp_sign_as and $smime_default_key are inappropriate to use, as
	they specify signing key/certs. In some cases, this is a different
	value than the encryption key/cert.

2017-05-29 11:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (085fc55029d8)

	* smime.c: Convert classic s/mime to space delimit findKeys output.

	Unlike gpgme and classic pgp, smime used a "cert\ncert\n" pattern.
	Convert to use a space-delimited format, so the self-encrypt option
	code can be uniform across pgp, s/mime, and gpgme.

	* mx.c: Fix memory leak when closing mailbox and using the sidebar.

	The code updating the sidebar counts decremented the msgcount, but
	did not set it back to the original value. Which means fastclose was
	not freeing all the headers.

	Update the sidebar only when something is deleted, since I don't
	believe it's required otherwise and the code is a bit cleaner that
	way.

	open-append borrows the idata just for the connection. The "mailbox

	mailbox.

	Don't free the idata "mailbox specific" part when closing an open-
	append mailbox.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for discovering the bug as part of testing
	the revised IMAP fetch_headers code (in the default branch).

	* mx.c: Fix potential segv if mx_open_mailbox is passed an empty
	string. (closes #3945)

	If path is "", ctx->path will be NULL. realpath() generally will
	segv if the first parameter is NULL.

2017-05-22 04:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4ab3a8a2e321)

	* imap/message.c: Fix mfc overflow check and uninitialized variable.

	The check borrowed from mx_alloc_memory() works because it is
	incremented 25 at a time. I don't believe it will work for the
	direct set case used in imap_alloc_msn_index(). Instead, use a more
	conservative check.

	In imap_read_headers(), make sure mfhrc is initialized. It would be
	tested without being set if imap_cmd_step() returned OK right away.

	* imap/message.c: Don't abort header cache evaluation when there is a
	hole. (see #3942)

	Instead, find the first missing MSN and generate a more complicated
	sequence set specifying the missing ranges.

	This removes the assumption that the header cache query returned
	results in MSN order.

2017-05-21 18:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1658ab70377b)

	* imap/message.c: Small imap fetch fixes. (see #3942)

	Add an integer overflow test, pulled from mx_alloc_memory(), since
	the count comes from a potentially hostile server.

	After reviewing the RFC a bit, it turns out the server is not
	supposed to send EXPUNGE responses during a FETCH. Change the
	comment, but keep the conservative code.

2017-05-21 10:51 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f87c679e508f)

	* imap/message.c: Properly adjust fetch ranges when handling new mail.
	(see #3942)

	When pulling down headers, it is possible for expunge responses to
	happen too. If we get a new mail count, we need to take into account
	changes to the max_msn due to the expunges.

2017-05-20 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (77d3173aecff)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Add msn_index and max_msn to find and check boundaries by MSN. (see
	#3942)

	Since there can be gaps in MSNs, the largest MSN in the context is
	not necessarily ctx->msgcount.

	Use max_msn instead of ctx->msgcount for:
	  - the starting MSN of new mail header fetching
	  - boundary checking in fetch, expunge, and other places

	Use msn_index to efficiently look up headers by MSN. This makes the
	expunge code slightly more efficient. It also makes FETCH handling,
	and duplicate FETCH FLAG handling efficient.

2017-05-20 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5289d2caadbb)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Start fixing imap_read_headers() to account for MSN gaps. (see
	#3942)

	Change the parameters to pass MSN instead of index, to make a bit
	simpler.

	Change header cache evaluation to look at the largest MSN retrieved
	instead of ctx->msgcount for the next fetch start point. This still
	depends on the assumption that MSNs are retrieved in ascending
	order, which needs to be fixed.

	Simplify the header cache inner loop termination and memory cleanup
	logic. Fix a memory leak if a hole in the header cache occured.

	Fix the header retrieval logic to take into account MSN gaps in the
	results. Loop only as long as we get IMAP_CMD_CONTINUE instead of
	over a fixed count. Simplify the inner loop termination and memory
	cleanup logic too.

	Simplify the "new mail while fetching" logic by creating a third
	outer loop to handle re-fetches.

	Fix msg_fetch_header() to return -2 if msg_parse_fetch() encounters
	a corrupt FETCH response. Previously it would pass on the rc of
	msg_parse_fetch(), meaning it would return -1 even though the
	response was corrupt.

2017-05-20 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ab3595fbb698)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Fix imap expunge to match msn and fix
	index. (see #3942)

	The expunge needs to match against the MSN now. Since
	cmd_parse_expunge() does not automatically fix h->index anymore,
	change imap_expunge_mailbox() to fix up the h->index values.

2017-05-20 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (27bb55faa024)

	* imap/message.c, imap/message.h: Move the IMAP msn field to
	IMAP_HEADER_DATA. (see #3942)

	Ticket 3942 revealed that it is possible for a FETCH to have gaps in
	the MSN numbers of the results. The code makes many assumptions that
	equate context index counts and MSN. This is the first in a series
	of commits fixing that assumption.

	The header->index field is supposed to hold the SORT_ORDER index
	number of the message. If there are gaps in the MSN, than the
	highext MSN can in fact be out of the range 0..ctx->msgcount-1.

	After studying the code, I believe curs_main.c would actually work
	with header->index values out of the range, at least for IMAP. But
	some other parts of the code, such as mutt_reopen_mailbox(), do rely
	on the values being a valid index to ctx->hdrs[]. And the
	intertwining of menu->oldcurrent with header->index values makes me
	nervous about future changes.

	So, to be safe, move the MSN to its own field in IMAP_HEADER_DATA.

	The next commit will fix the EXPUNGE behavior.

2017-05-13 09:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4bffaa6d189a)

	* history.c: Don't filter new entries when compacting history save
	file.

	If new entries are added between the two passes, they won't be in
	the dup_hash. The original intent was to filter added duplicates,
	but the check would also filter brand new entries.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, history.c, init.h: Also remove duplicates from
	the history file.

	When $history_remove_dups is set, remove duplicates from the history
	file when it is periodically compacted.

2017-05-12 18:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e66c6c0e8cc6)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, history.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add
	$history_remove_dups option to remove dups from history ring.

	When set, duplicate entries will be removed from the history ring
	when a new entry is added. The duplicate removal rearranges the
	history ring such that created empty slots are right after the
	"last" position in the ring, preserving the most history.

	Rewrite the next/prev functions to take into account that blank
	slots can now be in the middle of the array.

	* imap/imap.c: Turn IMAP_EXPUNGE_EXPECTED back off when syncing.
	(closes #3940).

	imap_sync_mailbox() turned on IMAP_EXPUNGE_EXPECTED when issuing a
	EXPUNGE command during a sync. However, it forgot to turn it back
	off.

	That meant that an unexpected EXPUNGE that occurred during a
	mx_check_mailbox -> imap_check_mailbox() -> imap_cmd_finish() call
	was not setting idata->check_status = IMAP_EXPUNGE_PENDING; and so
	imap_check_mailbox() was not returning MUTT_REOPENED.

	This meant that although the Context had been changed, the index did
	not run update_index(), resulting in a possible segfault.

	Thanks to Uroš Juvan for reporting the issue, and his invaluable
	description of how to reproduce the problem.

	* init.c, init.h, menu.c, mutt_menu.h, pager.c: Create R_PAGER_FLOW
	config variable flag.

	Use this for $header_color_partial, $markers, and $smart_wrap. When
	these options are changed in the pager, this flag will force a
	recalculation of lineInfo.

	Remove the manual checks in OP_ENTER_COMMAND for $markers and
	$smart_wrap, and instead use the same REDRAW_FLOW processing used
	for a SigWinch.

2017-05-09 16:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3fd8c4af4658)

	* curs_lib.c, mutt_menu.h, pager.c: Rename REDRAW_SIGWINCH to
	REDRAW_FLOW.

	The next patch will attach this redraw flag to pager settings. The
	former name becomes somewhat confusing with the expanded usage, so
	rename it to something more relevant to what is being redrawn.

2017-05-08 18:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (92d9db08a35e)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, mutt.h, pager.c: Add
	$header_color_partial to allow partial coloring of headers.

	When set, a regexp match will color only the matched text in the
	header. When unset (the default), the entire header will have color
	applied.

	With appropriate regexps, this allows coloring of just the header
	field name. Of course, it can also be used to highlight arbitrary
	phrases in the headers too.

2017-05-07 15:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5006a0a36405)

	* mh.c: Improve maildir and mh to report flag changes in
	mx_check_mailbox() (closes #3865)

	mx_check_mailbox() would update the header flags, but was not
	returning MUTT_FLAGS back to the index loop. That meant a screen
	redraw was needed to be notified of externally modified flags.

	Change maildir_update_flags() to return 1 if the flags were actually
	changed. Change maildir_check_mailbox() and mh_check_mailbox() to
	return MUTT_FLAGS when that happens.

	Thanks to jcdenton and mike-burns for the original patch.

	will have incorrect values.

	* curs_main.c, menu.c, pager.c, postpone.c: Change message modifying
	operations to additively set redraw flags.

	With the ability to set redraw flags with the menu stack operations,
	some operations internally modify the current menu redraw flag. For
	instance, _mutt_set_flag() can now set REDRAW_SIDEBAR.

	Change the ops that modify messages to use 'redraw |= REDRAW_X'
	instead of overwriting the flag value.

	* mx.c: Fix sidebar count updates when closing mailbox. (closes #3938)

	The context unread and flagged counts were being updated too early
	in mx_close_mailbox(). Cancelling at any of the following prompts
	would leave them in an incorrect state. Additionally, $move could
	increase the delete count (for flagged messages), and $delete, if
	answered no, could turn off message deletion.

	Move all the sidebar buffy stat updating to the bottom of the
	function, after all the prompts and processing.

	* curs_lib.c, keymap.c, mutt_curses.h: Fix km_error_key() infinite
	loop and unget buffer pollution.

	'bind pager \Ch help' produces an infinite loop when an unbound key
	is pressed in the pager. The reason is because km_error_key() tries
	to verify that the key sequence is really bound to the OP_HELP
	operation. It does this by using km_expand_key(),
	tokenize_unget_string() on the resulting buffer, then checking if
	the next km_dokey() returns OP_HELP.

	The problem is that km_expand_key() does not always produce a string
	that is properly reparsed by tokenize_unget_string(). Control-h
	sequences are expanded to ^H. tokenize_unget_string() recognizes
	this as two characters '^' and 'H'. km_error_key() checks the OP
	returned, which is OP_PAGER_TOP for the '^'. This is not OP_HELP, so
	it prints a generic error and returns. This leaves the 'H' in the
	input buffer! Since 'H' (by default) is unbound in the pager, it
	retriggers km_error_key(), resulting in an infinite loop.

	The same issues can occur without control sequences: bind generic ?
	noop bind generic dq help In the index, hitting an unbound key will
	end up leaving 'q' in the unget buffer, because 'd' is bound in the
	index menu and will be read by km_dokey().

	A simple approach to fix this would be to just use the same code as
	in mutt_make_help(), which has no double-check. This would be no
	worse than the help menu, but can generate an inaccurate error
	message (e.g if '?' were bound to noop)

	This patch instead uses OP_END_COND as a barrier in the unget
	buffer. It directly inserts the keys in the OP_HELP keymap, instead
	of using km_expand_key() + tokenize_unget_string(). After calling
	km_dokey() it flushes the unget buffer to the OP_END_COND barrier.

	Thanks to Walter Alejandro Iglesias for reporting the bug.

	ctx->mx_ops ends up being NULL for both the case that ctx->magic is

	* filter.c, init.c, pgp.c, protos.h: Fix GPG_TTY to be added to
	envlist. (closes #3931)

	Changeset 37209157e33c converted filters to use the envlist.
	Unfortunately, I missed that pgp.c sets GPG_TTY when using the GnuPG
	agent. Convert to add GPG_TTY to the envlist too.

2017-04-17 17:40 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (851a7ec95399)

	* pager.c: Handle the pager sort prompt inside the pager.

	Display the prompt in the pager, so a multiline prompt or resize
	doesn't refresh the index menu. Then, bounce back through the index
	to handle resorting and status line updates.

	This also fixes cancelling to stay in the pager.

	* commands.c: Ensure mutt stays in endwin during calls to pipe_msg()
	(closes #3929)

	The previous commit solved the problem reported in #3929:
	progressbar output while downloading a message via IMAP was
	refreshing the mutt ncurses session after launching the pipe
	program.

	To ensure another place in the code doesn't inadvertantly generate
	output, wrap OPTKEEPQUIET around the calls to
	pipe_msg()/mutt_wait_filter() too.

	* imap/message.c: Silence imap progress messages for pipe-message.
	(see #3929)

	_mutt_pipe_message() calls endwin(), and then calls pipe_msg(). If
	an imap message body hasn't already been downloaded, this can end up
	calling imap_fetch_message().

	The progress messages in imap_fetch_message() were restoring curses,
	just after extract_url was running. This was leading to a condition
	where mutt curses didn't think the screen had changed after
	extract_url exited.

	There was already a check for isendwin() inside
	imap_fetch_message(), but it wasn't wrapped around the progressbar
	creation/usage. Add a check for those places too.

2017-04-05 16:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (303fc058692f)

	* query.c: Don't create query menu until after initial prompt. (see
	#3877)

	A resize in the prompt will trigger a redraw, but the data won't be
	loaded yet, displaying a blank screen instead of the previous menu.
	Once the query is done, the data is loaded, but the menu->redraw
	state has been changed by the resize.

	We could manually flag a redraw, but it makes more sense visually
	logically to just create the menu after the query and results are
	loaded.

	* curs_lib.c, pager.c: Separate out the pager menu redrawing. (see
	#3877)

	The pager relies on REDRAW_SIGWINCH, so add that to
	_mutt_get_field().

2017-04-05 16:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (dcc95921c3c5)

	* pager.c: Prepare for pager redraw separation. (see #3877)

	Move some of the code inside SigWinch handling into the REDRAW part
	of the code.

	SigInt is handled by mutt_getch(), so remove the redundant code from
	inside the pager.

2017-04-05 16:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (178bd8b53cab)

	* compose.c, menu.c, mutt_menu.h: Separate out the compose menu
	redrawing. (see #3877)

	Add a custom_menu_redraw to the menu and change menu_redraw() to
	call that instead if set.

2017-04-05 16:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (231fa2eff206)

	* curs_lib.c, enter.c, keymap.c, menu.c, mutt_menu.h: Change
	km_dokey() to pass SigWinch on for the MENU_EDITOR. (see #3877)

	Change _mutt_enter_string() to pass the SigWinch through for
	_mutt_get_field() or mutt_enter_string() to handle.

	Add a call to mutt_current_menu() in _mutt_get_field() to properly
	redisplay the screen in that case.

2017-04-05 16:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7f6ff45a7f59)

	* init.c: Remove redraw flag setting after mutt_endwin().

	There is no need to set a redraw flag in this case. The screen will
	automatically be properly redrawn on the next refresh().

	Remove, lest it get propagated.

2017-03-31 18:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8b9bbd983b1a)

	* commands.c, compose.c, curs_lib.c, curs_main.c, pager.c, protos.h:
	Remove refresh parameter from mutt_enter_fname().

	Also remove it from mutt_save_message(), which used it to pass
	through to mutt_enter_fname(). The callers of this already had
	redraw logic, to which REDRAW_STATUS merely needed to be added.

2017-03-31 18:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (68bbc47c8498)

	* init.c, init.h: Create R_MENU redraw option.

	Previously, the R_INDEX option meant both the index as well as all
	other menus. The removal of the OPTFORCEREDRAWINDEX option caused
	problems with redrawing other menus for options such as
	arrow_cursor.

	One solution would be change R_INDEX back to meaning "everything"
	except pager, but there are only a handful of options that affect
	other menus.

	Instead, create R_MENU to indicate options that affect either all
	menus or one of the other menus beside the index and pager.

	* curs_lib.c, curs_main.c, init.h, pager.c: Change reflow_windows() to

	A full redraw should always be set in this case. This also enables

	Remove the redraw parameter from ci_bounce_message() and

	* curs_lib.c: Fix mutt_refresh() pausing during macro events.

	Changeset a07e8215a0ef split input buffering into two pools.
	Unfortunately, the mutt_refresh() was not changed to check the
	correct buffer count, resulting in unnecessary refreshes during
	macros.

	The SSL interactive certificate prompts set OPTIGNOREMACROEVENTS and
	then put up a confirmation menu. Perhaps we've just been lucky, but
	it seems we should refresh the screen in those cases if we're in the
	middle of a macro. Add a check for this option in mutt_refresh()
	too.

	* init.c: Fix setenv overwriting to not truncate the envlist. (see
	#3922)

	The refactor in 2b9c40f13e13 exposed a bug I hadn't noticed. The
	match loop performed a FREE() on the slot. Then, below, it was
	checking if (*envp) to see whether it was overwriting or creating a
	new slot. However, FREE() nulls out *envp. This would end up
	truncating the envlist just after the set slot!

	Move the free down, using a mutt_str_replace(), when overwriting the
	slot.

	* filter.c, init.c, protos.h, system.c: Pass envlist to filter
	children too. (closes #3922)

	The new setenv patch neglected to pass the envlist for filters too.

	Unfortunately, the filter code was already set up to pass COLUMNS to
	children, so it needed to be changed to add this to the envlist
	instead.

	Factor out mutt_envlist_set() from the parse_setenv() function,
	which the filter code can then use to set COLUMNS after forking.

	* main.c: Fix conststrings type mismatches. (closes #3926)

	The generation programs for conststrings.c: txt2c.c and txt2c.sh,
	specified the resultant types as "unsigned char[]" while main.c
	declared them as "const char[]".

	txt2.c generates 0xXX hex codes for each individual character, thus
	the "unsigned" definition. With link-time optimization, some
	versions of gcc notice the mismatch and emit a warning.

	Change the declarations to match the definitions and cast to char[]
	when they are used.

	browser

	Mailbox list may not be properly displayed in a standard 80-column
	terminal window if the $folder variable contains a long URL. In such
	a case only left part of each entry name can be visible with the
	default value of $folder_format. What's worse, this visible part may
	not be enough to distinguish between the entries.

	Thus in this case mutt_pretty_mailbox() will be just as useful as

	* mutt_ssl.c: Add SNI support for OpenSSL. (see #3923)

	The original patch for this is by Phil Pennock at:
	https://people.spodhuis.org/phil.pennock/software/mutt-patches/

	I have removed the OpenSSL version check and
	defined(OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT) check because:
	  * SSL_set_tlsext_host_name() was added in 0.9.8f [11 Oct 2007]
	  * OpenSSL 1.1 no longer has the OPENSSL_NO_TLSEXT compilation option
	  * https://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2788&user=guest&pass=g
	uest shows that the no-tlsext compilation option has been broken for
	some time.
	  * Going forward, I'd like to minimize and start removing cruft
	required to support ancient/insecure versions of libraries.

2017-03-09 11:59 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (be5d02a8e782)

	* mutt_ssl.c: OpenSSL: Don't offer (a)ccept always choice for hostname
	mismatches. (closes #3914)

	On a hostname mismatch, saving the certificate is pointless because
	mutt will ask the user no matter if the certificate is saved or not.

	The only invocation allowing "accept always" is guarded by a call to
	check_certificate_digest(), which means the check_certificate_file()
	check is redundant. Therefore remove that check and add a comment
	noting why.

	Thanks to Matthias Andree for the original version of this patch.

	* mutt_ssl.c: Prevent skipped certs from showing a second time. (see
	#3916)

	OpenSSL sometimes passes a skipped certificate to
	ssl_verify_callback() a second time, with preverify_ok=1. From
	OpenSSL's viewpoint there is nothing wrong with this, but mutt will
	end up showing the certificate in the interactive prompt again.

	Cache the last cert and position, and compare with the latest when
	skip_mode and preverify_ok are both set.

	interactive prompt. (closes #3914)

	Check to make sure the certificate is not already in the

	To allow a cert with a new validity timespan to be added to the

	certficate file.

	* configure.ac, doc/makedoc-defs.h, init.h, mutt.h, mutt_ssl.c: Move
	the OpenSSL partial chain support check inside configure.ac. (see

	Instead of directly checking whether X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN is
	defined everywhere, do it once inside configure. This will allow
	better support in the future if the test needs to change.

	* doc/makedoc-defs.h, init.h, mutt.h, mutt_ssl.c: Add
	$ssl_verify_partial_chains option for OpenSSL. (closes #3916)

	The reworked OpenSSL certificate validation took away a "feature" of
	the previous implementation: the ability to reject a node in the
	chain and yet continue to the next node.

	If this new option is set to 'yes', enables OpenSSL's
	X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN flag to reinstate the functionality and
	permit to use a non-root certificate as the trust anchor.

	This option is only available if OpenSSL offers the
	X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN macro, which should be the case as of
	1.0.2b or later.

	Code written by Kevin McCarthy and Matthias Andree.

	Call ERR_clear_error() just before the call to SSL_connect() to make
	sure the error queue doesn't have any old errors in it.

	PEM_read_X509() sets an error PEM_R_NO_START_LINE on end-of-file.
	Clear that out so it doesn't show up as the SSL_connect() error
	message.

	* mx.c: Fix memory leak when closing mailbox and using the sidebar.

	The code updating the sidebar counts decremented the msgcount, but
	did not set it back to the original value. Which means fastclose was
	not freeing all the headers.

	Update the sidebar only when something is deleted, since I don't
	believe it's required otherwise and the code is a bit cleaner that
	way.

2017-05-22 18:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (59a2125b49f2)

	* imap/imap.c: Don't clean up idata when closing an open-append
	mailbox.

	open-append borrows the idata just for the connection. The "mailbox
	specific" part of the idata may be being used by a normal open-
	mailbox.

	Don't free the idata "mailbox specific" part when closing an open-
	append mailbox.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for discovering the bug as part of testing
	the revised IMAP fetch_headers code (in the default branch).

2017-05-22 05:08 -0700  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (1ddf2641f369)

	* mx.c: Fix potential segv if mx_open_mailbox is passed an empty
	string. (closes #3945)

	If path is "", ctx->path will be NULL. realpath() generally will
	segv if the first parameter is NULL.

2017-05-12 09:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a97afb72d892)

	* imap/imap.c: Turn IMAP_EXPUNGE_EXPECTED back off when syncing.
	(closes #3940).

	imap_sync_mailbox() turned on IMAP_EXPUNGE_EXPECTED when issuing a
	EXPUNGE command during a sync. However, it forgot to turn it back
	off.

	That meant that an unexpected EXPUNGE that occurred during a
	mx_check_mailbox -> imap_check_mailbox() -> imap_cmd_finish() call
	was not setting idata->check_status = IMAP_EXPUNGE_PENDING; and so
	imap_check_mailbox() was not returning MUTT_REOPENED.

	This meant that although the Context had been changed, the index did
	not run update_index(), resulting in a possible segfault.

	Thanks to Uroš Juvan for reporting the issue, and his invaluable
	description of how to reproduce the problem.

2017-05-05 13:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (71cb68efe98e)

	* curs_main.c: Don't modify LastFolder/CurrentFolder upon aborting a
	change folder operation.

	Set LastFolder and CurrentFolder after mx_close_mailbox() has
	successfully completed. Otherwise, if the close is aborted, they
	will have incorrect values.

2017-05-04 18:05 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c08c72a0e24c)

	* mx.c: Fix sidebar count updates when closing mailbox. (closes #3938)

	The context unread and flagged counts were being updated too early
	in mx_close_mailbox(). Cancelling at any of the following prompts
	would leave them in an incorrect state. Additionally, $move could
	increase the delete count (for flagged messages), and $delete, if
	answered no, could turn off message deletion.

	Move all the sidebar buffy stat updating to the bottom of the
	function, after all the prompts and processing.

2017-04-30 15:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (829584614fd6)

	* headers.c: Refresh header color when updating label. (closes #3935)

	color index with a '~y' pattern were not being updated after
	adding/removing labels.

2017-04-30 14:24 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c54ac874a32b)

	* init.c, init.h: Fix unused function warnings when sidebar is
	disabled. (closes #3936)

	parse_path_list/unlist are currently only used by the
	un/sidebar_whitelist commands. Add an ifdef around them to stop an
	unused function warning. Add a comment too, so it's clear why they
	are ifdef'ed.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Note that mbox-hooks are dependent on $move.

2017-04-27 21:22 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b8952095b583)

	* curs_lib.c, keymap.c, mutt_curses.h: Fix km_error_key() infinite
	loop and unget buffer pollution.

	'bind pager \Ch help' produces an infinite loop when an unbound key
	is pressed in the pager. The reason is because km_error_key() tries
	to verify that the key sequence is really bound to the OP_HELP
	operation. It does this by using km_expand_key(),
	tokenize_unget_string() on the resulting buffer, then checking if
	the next km_dokey() returns OP_HELP.

	The problem is that km_expand_key() does not always produce a string
	that is properly reparsed by tokenize_unget_string(). Control-h
	sequences are expanded to ^H. tokenize_unget_string() recognizes
	this as two characters '^' and 'H'. km_error_key() checks the OP
	returned, which is OP_PAGER_TOP for the '^'. This is not OP_HELP, so
	it prints a generic error and returns. This leaves the 'H' in the
	input buffer! Since 'H' (by default) is unbound in the pager, it
	retriggers km_error_key(), resulting in an infinite loop.

	The same issues can occur without control sequences: bind generic ?
	noop bind generic dq help In the index, hitting an unbound key will
	end up leaving 'q' in the unget buffer, because 'd' is bound in the
	index menu and will be read by km_dokey().

	A simple approach to fix this would be to just use the same code as
	in mutt_make_help(), which has no double-check. This would be no
	worse than the help menu, but can generate an inaccurate error
	message (e.g if '?' were bound to noop)

	This patch instead uses OP_END_COND as a barrier in the unget
	buffer. It directly inserts the keys in the OP_HELP keymap, instead
	of using km_expand_key() + tokenize_unget_string(). After calling
	km_dokey() it flushes the unget buffer to the OP_END_COND barrier.

	Thanks to Walter Alejandro Iglesias for reporting the bug.

2017-04-26 15:40 -0700  Roger Cornelius  <rac@tenzing.org>  (9a0afe7815d1)

	* mx.c: Fix error message when opening a mailbox with no read
	permission. (closes #3934)

	ctx->mx_ops ends up being NULL for both the case that ctx->magic is
	0 and -1. This meant the mutt_perror() error message was never being
	printed, because the check for ctx->mx_ops == NULL was taking place
	first.

	Move the "ctx->magic == -1" check first, so mutt will print out an
	appropriate perror message in that case.

	* filter.c, init.c, pgp.c, protos.h: Fix GPG_TTY to be added to
	envlist. (closes #3931)

	Changeset 37209157e33c converted filters to use the envlist.
	Unfortunately, I missed that pgp.c sets GPG_TTY when using the GnuPG
	agent. Convert to add GPG_TTY to the envlist too.

2017-04-08 14:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a8b1017a4cc1)

	* imap/message.c: Silence imap progress messages for pipe-message.
	(see #3929)

	_mutt_pipe_message() calls endwin(), and then calls pipe_msg(). If
	an imap message body hasn't already been downloaded, this can end up
	calling imap_fetch_message().

	The progress messages in imap_fetch_message() were restoring curses,
	just after extract_url was running. This was leading to a condition
	where mutt curses didn't think the screen had changed after
	extract_url exited.

	There was already a check for isendwin() inside
	imap_fetch_message(), but it wasn't wrapped around the progressbar
	creation/usage. Add a check for those places too.

2017-03-27 11:39 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (77032036c642)

	* curs_lib.c: Fix mutt_refresh() pausing during macro events.

	Changeset a07e8215a0ef split input buffering into two pools.
	Unfortunately, the mutt_refresh() was not changed to check the
	correct buffer count, resulting in unnecessary refreshes during
	macros.

	The SSL interactive certificate prompts set OPTIGNOREMACROEVENTS and
	then put up a confirmation menu. Perhaps we've just been lucky, but
	it seems we should refresh the screen in those cases if we're in the
	middle of a macro. Add a check for this option in mutt_refresh()
	too.

2017-03-20 10:16 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7cefa378ab7e)

	* init.c: Fix setenv overwriting to not truncate the envlist. (see
	#3922)

	The refactor in 2b9c40f13e13 exposed a bug I hadn't noticed. The
	match loop performed a FREE() on the slot. Then, below, it was
	checking if (*envp) to see whether it was overwriting or creating a
	new slot. However, FREE() nulls out *envp. This would end up
	truncating the envlist just after the set slot!

	Move the free down, using a mutt_str_replace(), when overwriting the
	slot.

2017-03-18 14:39 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2b9c40f13e13)

	* init.c: Fix mutt_envlist_set() for the case that envlist is null.

2017-03-18 13:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (37209157e33c)

	* filter.c, init.c, protos.h, system.c: Pass envlist to filter
	children too. (closes #3922)

	The new setenv patch neglected to pass the envlist for filters too.

	Unfortunately, the filter code was already set up to pass COLUMNS to
	children, so it needed to be changed to add this to the envlist
	instead.

	Factor out mutt_envlist_set() from the parse_setenv() function,
	which the filter code can then use to set COLUMNS after forking.

2017-03-05 15:24 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f0e3b2875065)

	* account.h: Increase ACCOUNT.pass field size. (closes #3921)

	#3921 reported his password token used for Google XOAUTH2 is size
	129. The ACCOUNT structure currently uses a size 128 buffer. Who
	knew a password field would ever be bigger than that?

	Since the ACCOUNT structure has no allocation/dellocation routines,
	the easiest fix is to increase the size. Bump the size up to 256.

	* getdomain.c: Prevent null pointer exception for h->ai_canonname

	The getaddrinfo call in line 54 sets &h to a struct addrinfo. If a
	canonical name cannot be found for the node argument of getaddrinfo,
	h->ai_canonname is set to NULL. In that case, the strchr call in
	line 58 can lead to segfault. This behavior was observed on a macos
	sierra while the hostname was 192.168.1.3 (unfortunately this
	happens quite often in macos).

	The fix is simple, just check h->ai_canonname for the NULL value.

	Change PEM_read_X509() call to reuse cert to avoid free/reallocation
	overhead.

	OpenSSL has trouble establishing the chain and verifying when

	operation to be a noop and remove the malloc from its fetch
	function.

	* configure.ac, doc/manual.xml.head, hcache.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add
	Kyoto Cabinet support to the header cache.

	Retain the defaults as they are, although we might switch to Kyoto
	Cabinet for the next major release.

2017-02-04 12:53 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (fca7e504ab6a)

	* hcache.c: Fixes to the LMDB header cache. (closes #3691)

	Use mdb_txn_abort() to free up readonly/reset transactions, and
	avoid leaking memory.

	Fix hcache_delete() key generation - looks like this was an
	incorrect copy/paste from the bdb code.

	Use dprint, not fprintf, for debugging messages.

	Remove strange blending of enum and bitfield logic for the txn_mode
	state.

	Remove some duplicate code from store/fetch raw.

2017-02-04 12:53 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (42aa8b19da95)

	* configure.ac, hcache.c: Add LMDB backend support for header cache.
	(see #3691)

	Based on the original from JP Mens:
	https://gist.github.com/jpmens/15969d9d678a3d450e4e

	The following performance patch was manually applied on top of the
	original patch: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/7e5380cd4c
	40d119ff83b2cf5f51f2cdb8a95ab3

	A variant of this patch was added to handle larger mailboxes: https:

	Thanks to all the developers and contributors to this patch, and to
	Fabian Groffen for bundling and posting this to mutt-dev.

2017-01-31 15:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (142a87f0c855)

	* enter.c: Minor fix to ~y completion.

	Make sure the entire ~y is before curpos when enabling completion.

2017-01-31 14:27 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (82034c72b6da)

	* enter.c, init.c, protos.h: Simplify mutt_label_complete().

	It was derived from mutt_command_complete(), which had more complex
	requirements. For labels, we just need to skip whitespace and
	complete based on the passed in buffer.

	Therefore, we don't need the pos parameter, or to work backwards
	from the end of the buffer.

2017-01-31 14:27 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (298654f1d70c)

	* enter.c: Permit tab completion of pattern expressions with ~y
	(labels).

	Thanks to David Champion for the original patch. This version is
	slightly different, as I couldn't get the original patch working.
	This version simply scans backward for the first ~, and if it is ~y,
	invokes completion.

2017-01-31 14:27 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9ca99f2b1205)

	* enter.c: Fix the mutt_label_complete() pos parameter.

	i is the state->wbuf index, not the end of the buf. It was "working"
	only because the contents of buf past the null were not "space" most
	of the time.

2017-01-29 11:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ab2f8882633b)

	* copy.c: Fix the x-label update code check location.

	The x-label comparison was outside the "beginning of header" block.

	This meant that it could theoretically match a continuation line.
	Additionally, the continuation lines of x-labels would not be
	stripped, because the comparison was after the ignore variable was
	reset.

	Move the comparison inside the block and before the ignore reset.

2017-01-28 18:48 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d0909785d945)

	* curs_main.c, globals.h, headers.c, init.c, main.c, mbox.c, mutt.h,
	mx.c, pop.c, protos.h: Improve the label completion hash table
	usage.

	Move the hash table inside the Context. Hook message
	arrival/deletion to update the label hash.

	Change the label hash to strdup keys.

	Use hash_find_elem when updating the counter, to reduce unnecessary
	add/delete operations.

2017-01-28 18:47 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (66cc205ea76a)

	* curs_main.c, doc/manual.xml.head, enter.c, globals.h, headers.c,
	init.c, main.c, mutt.h, protos.h: Adds label completion.

	A global label hash is added, to which labels are added as they're
	parsed from a mailbox file or edited manually by the user. Reference
	counts are kept in the hash table so that unused labels are removed
	from available completions. Completion is available in the label
	editor only, but it may be feasible to add for search expressions if
	the preceding text ends with '~y'.

2017-01-28 18:47 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (51c5e574a082)

	* hash.c, hash.h: Add hash_find_elem to get the hash element.

	This will be used in the following patch for directly manipulating
	the label counter.

2017-01-28 18:47 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (169b67b5b666)

	* hash.c, hash.h: Add reentrant hash_walk() function for iterating
	down a hash table.

2017-01-28 18:47 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (95b892b3f856)

	* commands.c, copy.c, curs_main.c, functions.h, headers.c, pager.c:
	Minor fixes to the x-label patch from David.

	Add L10N comment to sort menu. Mark a couple strings for
	localization.

	Use ascii_strncasecmp() for the X-Label header comparison.

	Simplify label_message() using mutt library routines.

	Bind label editing to "Y" instead of "y". "y" is already used in the
	default sample muttrc to display mailboxes.

2017-01-28 18:47 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (67525605640e)

	* OPS, commands.c, copy.c, copy.h, curs_main.c, doc/manual.xml.head,
	functions.h, headers.c, imap/imap.c, init.h, mh.c, mutt.h, pager.c,
	protos.h, sort.c, sort.h: Adds capability to edit x-labels inside
	mutt, and to sort by label.

2017-01-24 15:33 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e4ad1dc9bfbd)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.c: Allow "unsubjectrc *" to remove all
	patterns.

	Thanks to Aaron Schrab for the original patch.

2017-01-23 19:01 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (9e876d64d3c8)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, globals.h, hdrline.c, init.c, init.h, mutt.h,
	muttlib.c: Add subjectrx command to replace matching subjects with
	something else.

	This lets you define regular expressions-replacement pairs for
	subject display. When a Subject: matches the regular expression, the
	replacement value will be displayed instead in the message index.
	Backreferences are supported.

	This is especially nice for simplifying subjects that are overly
	wordy, such as mailing list posts (with [Listname] tags, etc), mail
	from ticketing systems or bug trackers, etc. It lets you reduce
	clutter in your mutt display without altering the messages
	themselves.

2017-01-23 19:01 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (f05df6b258f3)

	* globals.h, hcache.c, init.c, mutt.h, muttlib.c, protos.h: Abstract
	the SPAM_LIST as a generic REPLACE_LIST

	REPLACE_LIST can be used more generally as a list of pattern match-
	replace settings. SPAM_LIST was a special case of this, so spam
	handling has been been changed to use REPLACE_LIST instead, and
	SPAM_LIST was removed.

	A generic function for performing a REPLACE_LIST replacement has
	been added in mutt_apply_replace().

	Commited by Kevin McCarthy with some buffer overflow fixes in
	mutt_apply_replace().

2017-01-23 18:46 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7a8ea1bb09f0)

	* send.c: Improve Reply-to vs From comparison when replying. (closes
	#3909)

	Prior to this patch, if the Reply-to mailbox matched the From
	mailbox, mutt would always use the From address. This was probably
	done to preserve the display name, as the Reply-to address is often
	missing one.

	Unfortunately, there are circumstances where the Reply-to display-
	name has significance, such as in ticket 3909.

	Change mutt so that it only uses the From address if the Reply-To
	has no display-name.

2017-01-19 14:58 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b57c695b7923)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, sidebar.c, sort.h: Fix sidebar
	references to the "new count" to be "unread". (closes #3908)

	%N in $sidebar_format and "new"in $sidebar_sort_method actually use
	the unread message count. Update the documentation to mention that.

	Add an "unread" method to $sidebar_sort_method, but preserve "new"
	for compatibility.

	Change the SORT_COUNT_NEW constant to SORT_UNREAD, so the code is
	also consistent with the meaning.

	Thanks to cri for reporting the problem and suggesting where to fix
	it in the code.

2017-01-17 16:09 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a555ada578b8)

	* addrbook.c, alias.c, init.c: Fix several alias hashtable issues.

	Convert to use the strdup keys hash. Addresses can be converted back
	and forth from intl to local forms. This frees and recreates a new
	addr->mailbox string, resulting in the hash table key being a
	dangling pointer.

	Change alias hash table insert/remove to ensure the address is in
	intl form. The alias menu (previously) converted address entries to
	local form when performing a completion. Even with the pointer issue
	fixed, the entries may not be removed from the hash if the intl and
	local forms are different.

	Lastly, there is no reason for the alias menu to manually convert to
	local form before writing the address to the output buffer.
	rfc822_write_address() has a display parameter that will call
	mutt_addr_for_display() instead when set. Change to set the display
	parameter and remove the conversion calls.

	This last change obviates the first two changes, but they are a good
	idea in any case.

2017-01-17 16:09 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (fc6990144167)

	* hash.c, hash.h, init.c: Add casecmp and strdup_key flags to
	hash_create()

	Aliases and (in the future), X-Label hashes will require a hash that
	strdups the key. Convert the casecmp parameter of hash_create() to a
	flags parameter, and add a flag to strdup the keys.

2017-01-15 10:00 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ac1a2af3aff4)

	* mx.c: Improve error handling in mbox magic detection.

	Thanks to Simon Ruderich for pointing out several small issues with
	the previous commit.

2017-01-14 19:18 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (945a3f4b15c7)

	* mx.c: Allow initial blank lines in local mailboxes.

	Some mailbox-creation tools erroneously append a blank line to a
	file before appending a UNIXv7-format mail message, resulting in
	mailboxes that are intended to be valid "mbox" folders but are not.
	Notably old versions of Mailman do this, making archive files that
	cannot be read by mutt.

	This patch causes mutt to skip leading NLs and CRs when detecting
	magic.

2017-01-10 14:48 -0800  Simon Ruderich  <simon@ruderich.org>  (79306170e367)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head: Fix minor documentation
	issues.

	manual.xml: Wrap line for clarity.

	muttrc.man: Remove superfluous spaces in brackets. Add missing error
	object in color command. Sort the prompt object. Add sidebar color
	objects.

2017-01-06 14:37 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7c0e7a0769e4)

	* imap/command.c: Convert cmd_parse_search to use the uid hash.
	(closes #3905)

	Replace the linear scan for each result with a hash lookup. This
	should greatly improve performance for large mailboxes.

2017-01-06 14:23 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1ad1013cbf5b)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Create a uid hash
	for imap. (see #3905)

	This hash will allow for more efficient UID SEARCH processing,
	replacing a linear scan with a hash lookup.

2017-01-06 14:17 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ebb93147aec7)

	* hash.c, hash.h, thread.c: Convert HASH to be indexable by unsigned
	int. (see #3905)

	Convert the HASH to be usable for either string or unsigned int
	keys, so that a uid hash can be added for imap.

	To keep hash-usage code disruption to a minimum, this introduces new
	create/insert/find/delete functions for the int hash, but keeps the
	old function names for string keys.

	This implementation makes the key a union. It may have been a better
	idea to introduce a whole new structure, but this way allows minimum
	changes to and maximum reuse of the existing hash code.

2017-01-04 19:45 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4f0a84b954ef)

	* imap/command.c: Fix imap server-side search to call uid2msgno() only
	once. (see #3905)

	After performing a UID SEARCH, the results are parsed in
	cmd_parse_search(). This was accidentally calling uid2msgno() twice.
	Since that function does a linear search, this has a noticable
	impact on large search results.

2017-01-02 18:08 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (23b02a482bde)

	* curs_main.c, hook.c, mutt.h, pattern.c, protos.h, score.c: Add a
	pattern_cache_t to speed up a few repeated matches.

	Vincent Lefèvre reported experiencing an index display performance
	issue. This occurred with messages containing many recipients. He
	had many index color lines containing ~l. The ~l ended up being run
	over and over on these messages, resulting in a noticable slowdown
	displaying the index.

	This patch adds caching for just a few of the pattern operations
	(~l, ~u, ~p, ~P) that are potentially expensive and also don't have
	arguments. The caching is only enabled for operations repeatedly
	matching against the same message: color, hooks, scoring.

	The caching is fairly targeted, but isn't that invasive or
	complicated.

2016-12-31 19:57 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2bc2ec9ac664)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Canonicalize line endings for GPGME S/MIME
	encryption. (closes #3904)

	This matches the behavior for S/MIME classic mode: OpenSSL converts
	the line endings to cr/lf before encrypting. Although Mutt always
	canonicalizes the line endings before verifying the signature, some
	clients do not do this for encrypted messages.

	Thanks to cooler for the patch!

2016-12-27 15:23 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4cb0cd767af2)

	* globals.h, hdrline.c, init.h, status.c: Make to_chars and
	status_chars accept mulitibyte characters. (closes #3024)

	Change Tochars and StChars to use the mbchars_table type introduced
	in the last commit.

2016-12-27 15:23 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1d054932abfb)

	* doc/makedoc.c, init.c, init.h, mutt.h: Create mbchar_table type for
	multibyte character arrays. (see #3024)

	This type is to allow multibyte characters in to_chars and
	status_chars while preserving efficient indexing to each character.

	The arrays are tokenized during initialization, and are re-tokenized
	as the values are unset, reset, and set.

2016-12-25 23:31 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (1303567a6ad1)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: In the manual, replaced 2 para by example
	(similar to the first example).

2016-12-13 12:19 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (b112fd7061fb)

	* curs_main.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add option to control whether threads
	uncollapse when new mail arrives.

	Adds $uncollapse_new: when set, the default, a collapsed thread into
	which a new message arrives will be uncollapsed to reveal the new
	message.

2016-12-13 12:02 -0800  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (1f04f9145eb1)

	* OPS: Remove unused OPS

	OP_MAIN_FIRST_MESSAGE and OP_MAIN_LAST_MESSAGE were added to the
	code 19 years ago. They weren't used then; they haven't been used
	since.

2016-12-13 11:16 -0800  Michał Kępień  <mutt@kempniu.pl>  (b985c324932b)

	* mutt_ssl.c: Rework OpenSSL certificate verification to support
	alternative chains. (closes #3903)

	The way Mutt currently verifies SSL certificates using OpenSSL does
	not support alternative chains, which may cause confusion when some
	popular mail providers (e.g. Gmail) are used with specific sets of
	trusted CA certificates.

	Replace the "manual" verification done by mutt in
	check_certificate_by_signer() with SSL_set_verify() using a
	callback. OpenSSL then does the certificate verification, including
	properly looking at alternative chains. The callback still provides
	the opportunity to override using ~/.mutt_certificates or an
	interactive prompt.

2016-12-11 18:56 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (8a23708d978b)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.c, init.h, main.c, system.c: Add
	setenv/unsetenv commands.

	These can be used to add and remove environment variables passed to
	children via mutt_system().

	Commited by Kevin McCarthy with some cleanup.

2016-12-06 19:07 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (df1d1e379477)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Move '@' pattern modifier documentation to the
	right section.

	Somehow, the patch got out of date and the documentation shifted to
	another section. Relocate back to the "Pattern Modifier" section.

2016-11-26 00:57 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (a0a970530a8b)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt-gpgme.h, crypt-mod-pgp-gpgme.c: Fix build

2016-11-19 19:35 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (10c4761cea89)

	* mutt_ssl.c: More openssl1.1 fixes: remove uses of X509->name in
	debugging. (closes #3870)

	X509->name was a shortcut for the longer name = X509_NAME_oneline
	(X509_get_subject_name (cert), buf, sizeof (buf)); invocation.
	Change the debugging to print the cert name and chain names in the
	ssl_check_certificate() loop instead.

2016-09-07 20:00 -0700  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (2c1d79d3edd5)

	* configure.ac, mutt_ssl.c: Fix openssl 1.1 compilation issues.
	(closes #3870)

	With these changes, Mutt will no longer compile for versions less
	than 0.9.6.

2016-12-03 15:24 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d6c10244793f)

	* sidebar.c: Change sidebar_spoolfile coloring to be lower precedence.

	Give sidebar_new and sidebar_flagged higher precedence than
	sidebar_spoolfile, so that new and flagged message colors will show
	up for the spoolfile in the sidebar.

	Thanks to Till Smejkal for the original patch.

2016-11-29 17:48 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d72caeecf4af)

2016-11-29 17:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1196c859942e)

	* lib.h, mutt_ssl.c: Add mutt_array_size macro, change
	interactive_check_cert() to use it. (see #3899)

	While I have reservations about the construct, it does make the
	interactive_check_cert() menu->max and part loop less fragile.

2016-11-29 17:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1a2dc7b21b5b)

	* mutt_ssl.c: Improve openssl interactive_check_cert. (closes #3899)

	Don't use X509_NAME_oneline() with a fixed size buffer, which could
	truncate the string, perhaps leaving off the CN field entirely.
	Instead, work directly off the X509_NAME.

	Rather than use strstr to tokenize it, call
	X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID() with the nid types. Although
	X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID() is "legacy", it is the most directly
	useful for mutt in this simple interactive prompt.

	The function was set up to include the ST and C fields in the
	prompt, but the loop limit was too low. I believe this was an
	oversight, so increase the loop to include those two fields.

	* mutt_ssl.c: Revert db13010a2e8d but add a comment. (see #3870)

	X509_NAME_oneline() always NULL-terminates the string, even when it
	has to truncate the data to fit in buf.

	Free the conn->sockdata on failure. conn->fd is not set until the
	bottom, and before it is set, conn->conn_close() will not be called.

	Close the pin pipe if the pout pipe fails.

	Call mutt_perror first on a fork failure. Calling after the close()
	may cause errno to be changed on a close failure.

	* mutt_tunnel.c: Don't close stderr when opening a tunnel. (closes
	#3726)

	Instead of closing stderr, redirect it to /dev/null in
	tunnel_socket_open(). Otherwise a program can accidentally open a
	file into handle 2 and then unknowingly use that when trying to
	print to stderr.

	Thanks to lotheac for the original patch, which I just modified
	slightly.

2016-11-19 19:35 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (695243ba6374)

	* mutt_ssl.c: More openssl1.1 fixes: remove uses of X509->name in
	debugging. (closes #3870)

	X509->name was a shortcut for the longer name = X509_NAME_oneline
	(X509_get_subject_name (cert), buf, sizeof (buf)); invocation.
	Change the debugging to print the cert name and chain names in the
	ssl_check_certificate() loop instead.

2016-11-20 01:41 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (d14ffd58d976)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2016-11-18 15:54 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4bed0172c27b)

	* OPS, curs_main.c, functions.h: Fix mark-message translation and
	keybind menu.

	Move the OP_MARK_MESSAGE and hotkey macro from MENU_GENERIC to the
	MENU_MAIN keymap. Putting the macro under generic prevents it from
	overriding a keybinding in the index (even if the function is bound
	to noop). Additionally, the macro can only be executed from the
	index, so it doesn't make sense as a generic keybinding.

	Use the term "hotkey" in both the OPS and km_bind description.

	Mark the km_bind description translatable.

	Add L10N messages for the new translation strings.

2016-11-18 14:20 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (46194ca48b2f)

	* compress.c: Improve two compress translation messages.

	Change the "Error executing" to "Error running", which is used in
	multiple places elsewhere in mutt. This also removes the unnecessary
	newline.

	Remove the leading space in the "Error compressing" message, and
	change it to match the error message in editmsg.c.

	* init.c: Revert changes made to mutt_find_cfg() in 3c6d322912e3

	The usage of MUTT_VERSION in mutt_find_cfg() was fine before the
	commit: it wasn't using MUTT_VERSION inlined into a string with
	format string substitution.

	Revert to the version of mutt_find_cfg() before that changeset.

2016-11-17 15:57 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (022b604bc46d)

	* OPS, curs_main.c, doc/manual.xml.head, functions.h, globals.h,
	init.h: Adds <mark-message> binding to create "hotkeys" for
	messages.

	<mark-message>foo<enter> will create a new macro "'foo" which will
	return to the current message by searching for that message's
	message id. The initial character of the macro is defined by
	$mark_macro_prefix, and defaults to "'" for verisimilitude vs. vi.

	Pushed by Kevin McCarthy with a minor fix.

	* commands.c, compose.c, dotlock.c, init.c, muttlib.c, status.c:
	Backout inlining of MUTT_VERSION in 42fee7585fae.

	If MUTT_VERSION contains a %, this will result in problems.

2016-11-16 16:05 -0800  David Champion  <dgc@bikeshed.us>  (91b3449f426b)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, mutt.h, pattern.c: Adds the '@' pattern
	modifier to limit matches to known aliases.

	Example: ~f joe matches messages from joe. @~f joe matches messages
	from any joe who is defined as an alias.

	Pushed by Kevin McCarthy with two minor cosmetic fixes.

	* flags.c, init.h, mh.c, mutt.h: When $flag_safe is set, flagged
	messages cannot be deleted.

	This saves them from bulk operations on threads and tagged messages.
	To remove a flagged message, first unflag it.

	* compress.c: Compress: check mailbox type if possible when appending.

	If an append hook isn't defined, then mutt has to decompress the
	mailbox. In that case, we can check the type of the decompressed
	mailbox instead of defaulting to DefaultMagic.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cad0051417eb)

	* compress.c, doc/manual.xml.head: Compress: escape single quotes when
	invoking the compress/decompress commands.

	The format strings are placed in single quotes. mutt_system()
	invokes sh, so escape the single quotes using bourne-shell syntax:
	'\''

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a51f1c8a038a)

	* compress.c: Compress: fix check_mailbox and sync_mailbox.

	Change check_mailbox to delegate to the child_ops->check_mailbox if
	the compressed mailbox has changed. This allows the mailbox to
	properly recover if both the decompressed mailbox and compressed
	file have changed.

	Change sync_mailbox to call check_mailbox before attempting to sync.
	This will prevent overwriting external changes to the compressed
	mailbox.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (0a7054904b5b)

	* compress.c, compress.h, imap/imap.c, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c,
	mx.h, pop.c, pop.h: Create mx_ops.sync operation. Refactor compress
	to use the mx_ops.sync.

	Change compress.sync_mailbox() to lock the compressed mailbox around
	both the tempfile sync and compress operations. This will prevent
	changes made inbetween the two syncs from being overwritten.

	Thanks to Damien Riegel for his original patch refactoring
	mx_ops.sync, which this patch is partially based upon.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (05f6bd8532ea)

	* compress.c: Compress: pull the lock/unlock operations into the
	open,close,sync operations.

	Some operations, such as open_append and sync, need an exclusive
	lock across a longer period than a single compress/decompress.
	Remove it from the execute_command and pull into the outer callers.
	Store lock information inside compress_info.

	Sync and check_mailbox need more fixes, which will be addressed in
	subsequent patches.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b1366f49c7b7)

	attacks.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7c055cc893dc)

	* compress.c: Compress: add delegate calls to open_append and close
	mx_ops functions.

	The open_append and close were partially duplicating mbox
	open_append and close operations internally. Change it to call the
	actual delegate functions instead.

	Inline the open_read() function inside open_mailbox(). Having it
	split improved nothing and just complicated the code (i.e. added
	error-handling checks in open_mailbox() that in reality could not
	fail).

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d1ff983c9bcb)

	* compress.c, compress.h, mx.c: Compress: fix several logic and memory
	bugs.

	setup_paths leaks memory: realpath is already set in
	mx_open_mailbox()

	restore_paths is unneeded. mx_fastclose_mailbox() will free stuff,
	and nothing is looking at the path once we are closing or aborting.

	Make a copy of the hooks. Otherwise 'unhook *' will leave dangling
	pointers.

	Add compress_info freeing inside mx_fastclose_mailbox(). Only free
	inside compress.c when we want to prevent close() from doing
	anything.

	close_mailbox() didn't preserve ctx->path on error.

	execute_command() didn't return an error if the mutt_system()
	command failed.

	mx_open_mailbox_append() should check mutt_comp_can_append() only
	for the case that the mailbox doesn't exist. When it exists,
	mx_get_magic() has already looked at the file contents before
	checking for matching open_hooks.

	In open_append_mailbox() if no append hook is defined, it should't
	call ci->open() if the mailbox doesn't exist. It should act just
	like append and create a temporary file.

	check_mailbox() needs more work. For now, at least have it properly
	close the mailbox on error.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c9c120d988a8)

	* commands.c: Compress: remove buffy stats "improvisation".

	Mutt doesn't support polling compressed mailboxes. This code creates
	a false impression and dirties mutt_save_message() in the process. I
	don't like it, so am taking it out.

2016-11-13 20:02 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (290631db373e)

	* compress.c, compress.h, hook.c, mx.c: Compress: prefix external
	functions with "mutt_"

	Also, include compress.h in compress.c so the mx_comp_ops doesn't
	need to be redeclared.

	With the following changes:
	- po/de.po changes trimmed to just the compress additions.

	- Move the sample muttrc to contrib, and add it to the Makefile.am

2016-11-13 18:45 -0800  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (42fee7585fae)

	* commands.c, compose.c, dotlock.c, init.c, muttbug.sh.in, muttlib.c,
	status.c: search muttrc file according to XDG Base Specification
	(closes #3207)

	First of all, the MUTT_VERSION symbol is now concatenated (when
	possible) at compile time.

	Then, the logic to find the config file has been changed a bit to
	remove unnecessary calls to access(), so now each possible locations
	for the config file is only tested once, and it stops as soon as a
	valid one has been found. So instead of:

	 access("/home/dkc/.muttrc-1.7.1", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file
	or directory) access("/home/dkc/.muttrc", F_OK) = 0
	access("/home/dkc/.muttrc", F_OK) = 0 access("/home/dkc/.muttrc",
	F_OK) = 0 [... Tests for Muttrc ... ] access("/home/dkc/.muttrc",
	F_OK) = 0

	We now have:

	 access("/home/dkc/.muttrc-1.7+13 (f658e517960e)", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT
	(No such file or directory) access("/home/dkc/.muttrc", F_OK) = 0

	It also cleans up the case where -F is passed on the command line
	but points to a non-existent file by moving the error path closer to
	the actual fail condition.

	Finally, it adds partial support for the XDG Base Directory
	Specification. mutt will now try to locate its config at:

	 $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc-MUTT_VERSION
	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mutt/muttrc.

	If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set, it will use '~/.config' as a default.

2016-11-08 12:42 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d18482f6641e)

	* mbox.c, mx.c: Move mbox close-append logic inside
	mbox_close_mailbox().

	The mx_fastclose_mailbox() calls mx_ops->close(), which invokes
	mbox_close_mailbox().

	Also, close the ctx->fp inside mbox_close_mailbox(). This way, the
	(to be added) compress logic can call the mx_ops->close() instead of
	"knowing" to close the fp before recompressing.

	mx_fastclose_mailbox() will safe_fclose() the fp again, but I'm
	leaving it there just in case I missed a usage of the fp in some
	other part of the code.

	Thanks to Damien Riegel for the original patch.

2016-11-07 18:10 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d0078268768d)

	* recvattach.c: Chain %d->%F->%f in the attachment menu.

	Previously, %d would use %f if there was no description set.

	Place the new %F option in between %d and %f. This way, %d will fall
	back on %F, which will fall back on %f. This allows the standard
	attachment menu to show d_filename.

	This is useful for forwarding attachments or editing draft files
	with attachments. In these cases the actual filename is sanitized
	but the attachment name is preserved in d_filename.

2016-11-07 18:10 -0800  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (82e566d393cf)

	* OPS, compose.c, functions.h: compose: add operation to rename an
	attachment

	As opposed to rename-file, which actually renames the underlying
	file of the attachment, rename-attachment puts a value in
	d_filename, which is used in the Content-Disposition header.

2016-11-07 18:06 -0800  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (a9e7402af4de)

	* init.h, recvattach.c: attach_format: add new %F placeholder

	I believe this patch originally came from Debian.

	Modified based on a suggestion from Fabian Groffen.

2016-11-03 10:17 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (ce07aa118214)

	Also, fix a test in case $withval is empty.

	Thanks to Sylvain Bertrand for the original patch.

2016-10-31 20:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b45bfce1bb0e)

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac: Add a --disable-doc configuration option.

	* attach.c, recvattach.c: Perform charset conversion on text
	attachments when piping. (closes #3773) (see #3886)

	When piping a text attachment, there is no reliable way to know the
	charset used.

	Vincent Lefèvre says: It was decided in the past that when there is
	no information on the charset in a transmission to an external
	command (e.g. as for mail composing), texts are expected to be
	transmitted in the local charset.

	Add a MUTT_CHARSET flag to enable charset conversion on text
	attachments for both when $attach_split is set and unset.

	#3888)

	The reporter had an html attachment with extremely long lines,
	combined with a color pattern of "color body default default ." This

2016-10-17 11:22 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (113b73b0b616)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Actually fix gpgme segfault in
	create_recipient_set().

	Changeset 6e44bfa16096 did not fix the segv. (Sorry, I made the fix
	based off a report on IRC but didn't trigger the segv myself: it was
	caused by an out-of-tree patch).

	The actual problem was that the rset was only resized on a
	successful gpgme_get_key(). However, on error, the array still needs
	to be NULL-terminated before calling free_recipient_set().

	Move the resize so it always takes place. This obviates the need for
	the NULL check added in 6e44bfa16096.

	$sidebar_divider_char. (closes #3887)

	The reporter had a $spoolfile of ~/Mailbox and a $folder of ~/Mail.
	The sidebar was truncating the spoolfile to "ox" because it only
	looked at a substring prefix match.

	RFCs 2732 and 3986 specify a literal IPv6 address be surrounded by
	"[]".

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix GPGME signature zero timestamp and locale
	awareness issues. (closes #3882)

	GPGME signature information has two minor problems.

	[-- Begin signature information --]
	*BAD* signature from: Name <user@example.com> aka: Name
	<user@example.org> created: Thu Jan 1 09:00:00 1970 [-- End
	signature information --]

	First, the created timestamp is incorrect when the message is not
	verified successfully.

	Second, as the code itself has some "TODO" comments, "aka" and
	"created" lines are not properly-aligned when LC_MESSAGES !=
	English.

	* pop_auth.c: Fix POP3 SASL authentication mechanism DIGEST-MD5.
	(closes #3862)

	sasl_client_step() returns SASL_OK after the fourth step: server
	auth confirmation. However, the protocol requires the client send
	one more blank line to the server, to which the server then replies
	with "+OK". See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5034#section-6.

	The code currently only sends a final response if sasl_client_step
	returns data to send. Change it to always send a final client
	message after the SASL_OK.

	* imap/imap.c: Mark IMAP fast-trash'ed messages as read before
	copying. (see #3860)

	Regular copying/saving messages in mutt via a UID COPY first calls
	imap_sync_message(). However that function is designed to sync all
	flags (including deleted), and so isn't useful for the fast-trash
	code.

	As an easier solution, instead add a UID STORE to set \\Seen for the
	same msgset as the trashed messages.

	* muttlib.c: Preserve forwarded attachment names in d_filename.

	When forwarding an attachment with an non-ascii name,
	mutt_copy_body() mangles the filename when calling mutt_adv_mktemp.
	Preserve the original attachment filename in d_filename.

	Remove the double copy of b->filename, which is a memory leak.

2016-10-01 16:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8963e77577ad)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Ensure signatures exist when verifying
	multipart/signed emails. (closes #3881).

	TAKAHASHI Tamotsu reported that when gpg2 isn't in PATH, the
	gpgme_op_verify() won't return an error, but instead will return a
	result with no signatures.

	verify_one() was only returning an error if a signature actually
	failed, so in this case the function was defaulting to returning
	success.

	Other callers of gpgme_op_verify() check to make sure the
	result->signatures exist before processing signatures. Add a check
	for verify_one() too.

2016-10-01 13:58 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e0c0a2820b8b)

	* url.c: RFC2047-decode mailto url headers after RFC2822 parsing.
	(closes #3879)

	Commit 55819a7e6169 performed the RFC2047 decode before the parsing.
	This works okay for headers such as subject, but for others such as
	address fields could lead to parsing errors.

	Change to perform a decode on envelope headers after all the calls
	to mutt_parse_rfc822_line(), using the same list of fields as
	mutt_read_rfc822_header().

	Change the do_2047 parameter of mutt_read_rfc822_line() to true, so
	that user headers are decoded if needed.

	* url.c: RFC2047-decode mailto header values. (closes #3879)

	* parse.c: Reset invalid parsed received dates to 0. (closes #3878)

	The actual problem in the ticket would be solved by d3f31cf9239e
	(see #3798). However there is still the bug that Mutt considers a
	(hdr->received != 0) to be set and usable, despite not checking the
	return value of mutt_parse_date().

	Change mutt_read_rfc822_header() to unset an invalid received value
	back to 0. We don't do this inside mutt_read_rfc822_line() because
	that would cause the next received line to be parsed.

2016-09-23 16:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ca8a3451b707)

	* pager.c: Clear pager position when toggling headers.

	It doesn't make sense to try to preserve the pager position when
	toggling headers: the purpose of toggling headers is to see the
	headers in full or weeded state. So, reset the position back to the
	top.

2016-09-22 14:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (87911ba95dae)

	* curs_lib.c, keymap.c: Don't abort the menu editor on sigwinch.
	(closes #3875)

	getch() will return ERR on sigwinch when timeout() is called with a
	positive value. mutt_getch() will therefore return ch==-2 for both a
	timeout and a sigwinch in this case.

	The imap code in km_dokey() exits out of the ImapKeepalive loop for
	a SigWinch, and was skipping past the check for MENU_EDITOR and
	tmp.ch==-2. Move this check below the gotkey: label so the
	ImapKeepalive loop behaves the same as the Timeout code.

	Thanks to nicop for reporting the problem and for the initial patch!

	translations as fuzzy. (closes #3874)

	Some translations for crypt-gpgme.c are marked as fuzzy but the
	keybindings attached to these translations are not, this creates
	confusions for the users who see the english message but have the
	keybindings for a message in their own language available.

	As long as the translations are fuzzy, the keybindings should stay
	fuzzy.

	Eike Rathke reported this happening when in an IMAP index view the

	When switching from pgp_* commands to crypt_use_gpgme=yes, Peter
	Colberg noticed that the output was colored 'brightyellow'.

	The issue is that crypt-gpgme.c uses state_attach_puts in various
	places where it should use state_puts to maintain compatibility with
	the previous behavior in pgp.c.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, pattern.c: Disable ~X when message scoring.
	(closes #3861)

	mutt_score_message() purposely passes a NULL context to
	mutt_pattern_exec(). The idea was to block slow patterns, and the
	scoring documentation notes this by saying:

	 "For efficiency reasons, patterns which scan information not
	available in the index, such as ~b, ~B or ~h, may not be used"

	~X needs the context to parse the messages (during message scoring
	at least), and thus isn't suitable for message scoring either.

	Block ~X from being used when the context is NULL. Add ~X to the
	list of patterns noted as unusable in the message scoring
	documentation.

	* browser.c, crypt-gpgme.c, crypt.c, globals.h, hdrline.c, init.h,
	main.c, pgpkey.c: Remove the $locale configuration variable.

	$locale was only used to set the LC_TIME locale. Unfortunately, Mutt
	previously defaulted to using "C". This overrode the user's locale
	setting and forced them to re-specify their locale inside their
	.muttrc.

	Remove $locale and instead use the locale specified by the
	environment. Mutt still allows "C locale" dates by using a leading
	"!" in $date_format, ${}, etc.

	Another use of $locale was to customize attribution dates using
	hooks. The next commit will introduce $attribution_locale, which can
	be used for this instead.

	Thanks to Derek Martin for the original patch!

	Changeset 6e44bfa16096 did not fix the segv. (Sorry, I made the fix
	based off a report on IRC but didn't trigger the segv myself: it was
	caused by an out-of-tree patch).

	The actual problem was that the rset was only resized on a
	successful gpgme_get_key(). However, on error, the array still needs
	to be NULL-terminated before calling free_recipient_set().

	Move the resize so it always takes place. This obviates the need for

2016-10-08 12:56 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (0ce5f9bff1fd)

	* ChangeLog, UPDATING, VERSION, po/bg.po, po/ca.po, po/cs.po,
	po/da.po, po/de.po, po/el.po, po/eo.po, po/es.po, po/et.po,

	mutt-1.7.1

2016-10-04 11:13 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5c5848dfa4ea)

	* muttlib.c: Preserve forwarded attachment names in d_filename.

	When forwarding an attachment with an non-ascii name,
	mutt_copy_body() mangles the filename when calling mutt_adv_mktemp.
	Preserve the original attachment filename in d_filename.

	Remove the double copy of b->filename, which is a memory leak.

2016-09-25 13:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (586dad383893)

	* parse.c: Reset invalid parsed received dates to 0. (closes #3878)

	The actual problem in the ticket would be solved by d3f31cf9239e
	(see #3798). However there is still the bug that Mutt considers a
	(hdr->received != 0) to be set and usable, despite not checking the
	return value of mutt_parse_date().

	Change mutt_read_rfc822_header() to unset an invalid received value
	back to 0. We don't do this inside mutt_read_rfc822_line() because
	that would cause the next received line to be parsed.

2016-09-21 18:10 -0700  Antonio Radici  <antonio@dyne.org>  (ee0fe5834195)

	* po/de.po, po/es.po, po/it.po: Mark some gpgme pgp menu keybinding
	translations as fuzzy. (closes #3874)

	Some translations for crypt-gpgme.c are marked as fuzzy but the
	keybindings attached to these translations are not, this creates
	confusions for the users who see the english message but have the
	keybindings for a message in their own language available.

	As long as the translations are fuzzy, the keybindings should stay
	fuzzy.

2016-09-21 22:51 +0200  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9f6e08ba6ff3)

	* mx.c: Check for NULL mx_ops in mx.c

	Eike Rathke reported this happening when in an IMAP index view the
	underlying connection was terminated, ctx->mx_ops was NULL and thus
	accessing ctx->mx_ops->check segfaulted.

	Thanks also to Eike Rathke for the initial patch, for which I
	expanded the checks to other functions.

2016-09-20 13:58 -0700  Antonio Radici  <antonio@dyne.org>  (8ed017079800)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix gpgme segfault when querying candidates with a
	'+' in the address. (closes #3873)

	list_to_pattern() was not allocating enough space for the '+' to
	'%2B' transformation.

2016-09-07 18:54 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a431c7618def)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Fix sidebar documentation a bit.
	(closes #3859)

	Sidebar_whitelist is a command, not a variable. Also add a blurb
	about what it does.

	Fix the sort order for $sidebar_divider_char and
	$sidebar_delim_chars.

2016-09-05 18:50 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cd127a968399)

	* contrib/Makefile.am: Add missing sidebar contrib sample files to
	dist tarball.

	I previously added the files, but neglected to add them to the
	contrib/Makefile.am file.

	Thanks to isdtor for pointing out the problem and for the original
	patch.

2016-09-05 12:35 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (bb25613ce8a4)

	* getdomain.c: Stub out getdnsdomainname() unless HAVE_GETADDRINFO.

	It seems unlikely there are systems without it (given that this
	mistake has been in since 1.6.0), but for correctness we should stub
	out the function for those without it.

2016-09-05 12:22 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (90c1b756d87d)

	* configure.ac: Autoconf: always check for getaddrinfo().

	The getdnsdomainname() function introduced in 1.6.0 uses
	getaddrinfo().

	Pull the dependency checks for libnsl, libsocket, and getaddrinfo()
	outside of the "need_socket" block, so they are always checked for.

2016-09-04 18:50 -0700  Guilhem Moulin  <guilhem@guilhem.org>  (b082bcd5d5e2)

	* pgppubring.c: Fix pgpring reporting of DSA and Elgamal key lengths.
	(closes #3867)

	Patch provided by Guilhem Moulin from an original idea of Fabrizio
	Tarizzo.

	The key length is always the length of the first MPI for RSA, DSA,
	and Elgamal.

2016-09-02 19:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ba5d900a90db)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, pattern.c: Disable ~X when message scoring.
	(closes #3861)

	mutt_score_message() purposely passes a NULL context to
	mutt_pattern_exec(). The idea was to block slow patterns, and the
	scoring documentation notes this by saying:

	 "For efficiency reasons, patterns which scan information not
	available in the index, such as ~b, ~B or ~h, may not be used"

	~X needs the context to parse the messages (during message scoring
	at least), and thus isn't suitable for message scoring either.

	Block ~X from being used when the context is NULL. Add ~X to the
	list of patterns noted as unusable in the message scoring
	documentation.

2016-09-02 16:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (eef1e8abc46f)

	* browser.c: Increase date buffer size for $folder_format. (closes
	#3863)

	The buffer size of 16 was sufficient to hold the %d format, but not
	for using %D. Change to use a SHORT_STRING.

	Thanks to Ian Zimmerman for the original patch, and to Antonio
	Radici for forwarding it on to us.

2016-08-17 20:17 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (328e1a32034b)

	* sys_socket.h: merge default into stable

2016-08-17 20:14 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e5fcfc5f9c2e)

	* .hgsigs: mutt-1.7.0 signed

2016-08-17 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (be1a70b1c080)

	* .hgtags: Added tag mutt-1-7-rel for changeset a4e83f60e42f

2016-08-17 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a4e83f60e42f)

	* po/ru.po: Updated Russian translation.

2016-08-09 14:32 -0700  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (08251fb01f90)

	* po/uk.po: Updated Ukrainian translation.

2016-08-08 13:13 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7abc19ad2d10)

	* curs_main.c, pager.c, protos.h: Clear pager position upon returning
	to the index menu.

	This fixes a bug where opening a message sometimes shows it scrolled
	down.

	The easiest way to trigger this is to open a long message in a
	mailbox with no new messages, scroll down, hit <next-new-then-
	unread> and then reopen the message. The pager will "remember" the
	position and scroll down. If you simply exit the message and re-
	enter it, the position is not saved.

	More annoyingly, once in a very great while I will open a new
	message and have the message scrolled down partway. I believe this
	is due to OldHdr happening to point to the same address as the
	Header of the new message.

	This is somewhat easily triggered on a mailbox with one message,
	which you open, scroll down in, hit <next-new-then-unread> to exit,
	and then delete/sync. In another mutt instance, copy the same
	messsage back to the mailbox, then open the message in the original
	mutt instance. At least some of the time, the OldHdr pointer matches
	the new message, and so it opens scrolled down.

	This patch solves the problem by clearing the pager position once
	all redirections through the index menu are done.

2016-08-06 23:35 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (15c4c16bed07)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2016-08-05 14:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (108ad5dcf194)

	* rfc2047.c: Remove nonsensical size check in mutt_choose_charset()

	The charsets parameter is being tokenized by the : delimeter.

	The checks against ENCWORD_LEN_MAX and ENCWORD_LEN_MIN make no
	sense, and appear to be the result of a large merge a very long time
	ago (changeset cb27682966d5).

	I can only guess where this check was supposed to be, but it
	certainly doesn't belong here.

2016-08-05 13:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a39c8bdca361)

	* rfc2047.c: Fix memory leak in mutt_choose_charset().

2016-08-05 13:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1ef5734f6593)

	* mh.c: Fix memleak in mh_read_dir() when sequence parsing fails.

2016-08-05 11:02 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f6b5f533f9ce)

	* COPYRIGHT, buffy.c, getdomain.c, globals.h, init.c, init.h, main.c,
	sidebar.c: Update copyright notices.

2016-08-02 19:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f9a4023b86ad)

	* pop.c: Explicitly NULL unimplemented pop mx_ops functions.

	The struct initialization already does this for unlisted fields, but
	I'd rather be explicit about unimplemented operations.

2016-08-02 19:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (01541185e6f4)

	* mx.c: Use the ctx->mx_ops instead of calling mx_get_ops()

	With mx_open_mailbox_append() setting the ctx->mx_ops, all contexts
	should have mx_ops set.

	Remove calls to mx_get_ops() and instead directly use ctx->mx_ops.

2016-08-01 18:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e778db6e693c)

	* mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c: Use a different flag in
	mx_open_mailbox_append() when mailbox doesn't exist.

	The previous commit re-used MUTT_NEWFOLDER, but the meaning of that
	flag is slightly different: it causes mbox to use fopen with mode
	"w", and is used only for the case of a brand-new mktemp-generated
	mbox.

	Setting it for other non-existing mbox files leads to a race
	condition between the stat and the fopen/lock, and so could end up
	truncating an existing mailbox created in-between!

	Create a different flag, MUTT_APPENDNEW to notify the open_append()
	functions that the mailbox doesn't exist. Change maildir and mh to
	check for that flag to create their directory structures.

2016-08-01 15:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2b9d6165b8b7)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c: Convert
	mx_open_mailbox_append() to use ctx->mx_ops.

	Set the flag MUTT_NEWFOLDER to signal Maildir and MH to create the
	directory structure.

	Distribute the "open append" code to mbox, mh, and imap/imap.c.

	Set pop's mx_ops handler to NULL to signal it is not supported.

2016-07-31 18:42 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3834da0c024e)

	* mbox.c, mx.c: Move fflush and fsync to the mbox and mmdf commit_msg
	functions.

	The case statement in mx_commit_message() was previously distributed
	to the various ops->commit_msg() handlers, but the fflush and fsync
	were not.

2016-07-30 11:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (27b77b5c97cf)

	* browser.c, browser.h, imap/browse.c, imap/imap.h, init.h: Add unread
	and total message count format strings to $folder_format.

	%n will show the unread message count in the mailbox. %m will show
	total message count. Except for %n with IMAP, these both require
	$mail_check_stats to be set, which puts these counts inside BUFFY.

	Since the imap_mboxcache is never fresher than the value in BUFFY,
	remove the special imap_mailbox_state() call. Instead, just update
	from the current Context for all mailboxes.

	Remove the logic that overrode the %N format string to show unread
	count for IMAP mailboxes. If they want to see unread count, they
	will have to change the $folder_format.

	Although it doesn't look possible to reuse browser_state.entry
	slots, change the OP_DELETE_MAILBOX to memset(0) the deleted slot.
	Then, we can change to logic in add_folder() so it doesn't need to
	zero-out unset values.

2016-07-25 12:25 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (4f4c258ab95c)

	* imap/command.c: Fix imap buffy msg_count overwrite issue.

	The sidebar updates the buffy->msg_count with the context. This can
	cause it to become out of sync with the imap_mboxcache.

	If the imap_buffy doesn't request MESSAGES, don't overwrite the
	buffy->msg_count with a stale value.

2016-07-22 14:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7b9763564598)

	* buffy.c, mx.c: Convert buffy_mbox_check() and trash_append() to use
	local context.

	buffy_mbox_check() was leaking the dynamically allocated context.
	Rather than add a call to free, just convert it to use a local
	variable.

	Make the same change to trash_append(), which doesn't need the
	dynamically allocated context either.

2016-07-21 14:00 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (81ecc31f8197)

	* mx.c: Fix memleak in the new trash folder code.

	Free the context in opened in trash_append()

2016-07-21 12:49 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (2d1279b26e22)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2016-07-20 16:29 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (89b266256a85)

	* mbyte.c, mbyte.h, pager.c: Filter directional markers that corrupt
	the screen. (closes #3854)

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for working on these utf-8 screen display
	issues.

2016-07-19 18:56 -0700  Anton Lindqvist  <anton.lindqvist@gmail.com>  (69bbe4da959f)

	* curs_lib.c: Fix arithmetic exception due to menu->pagelen being
	negative.

	Resizing the terminal window down to two lines when in an empty
	mailbox causes mutt to crash due to division by zero since menu->max
	equals 0 and menu->pagelen < 0 in status.c:205.

	Fixing the problem at this specific line felt wrong since I did
	notice menu->pagelen being negative. The pagelen is inherited from
	the rows calculation in mutt_reflow_windows. Since the number of
	lines can potentially be smaller than the accumulated number of rows
	acquired by the status, help and message window, make sure the
	calculation does not turn negative.

2016-07-17 19:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f1d5a884ffed)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mutt.h, mx.c: Add imap-fast-trash patch.

	This is based on the patch by Paul Miller.

	Modifications are:

	* Create a new flag, MUTT_TRASH for imap_make_msg_set(), rather than
	use MUTT_EXPIRED.

	* Change imap_make_msg_set(MUTT_TRASH) to only look at
	hdrs[n]->deleted && !hdrs[n]->purge, behaving like MUTT_TAG, rather
	than looking at the HEADER_DATA.

	* Reimplement imap_fast_trash() based on imap_copy_message(). It
	looks the old version was too, but it lacked handling of TRYCREATE
	and also queued the UID COPY but didn't exec it. (Presumably this
	happened in the subsequent sync).

	* Move the Context magic and mx_is_imap() checks outside of
	imap_fast_trash()

2016-07-17 19:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (280f9b195192)

	* OPS, curs_main.c, functions.h, pager.c: Add purge-message patch.

	This is based on the patch by Cedric Duval. Modifications are:

	* Use the exising M_PURGE flag from the trash folder patch, rather
	than adding a separate flag.

	* Undelete operations are already handled by the trash folder patch.

2016-07-17 19:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (20499921a4e5)

	* commands.c, curs_main.c, editmsg.c, flags.c, globals.h,
	imap/message.c, init.h, mbox.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pager.c, pattern.c,
	postpone.c: Add the trash folder patch.

	This is based on the trash folder patch by Cedric Duval.
	Modifications to the original patch are:

	* Use a flag called M_PURGE instead of M_APPENDED. The same flag is
	then used in the following "purge" patch instead of adding a
	different flag.

	* Removed the counter in context. The existing context->deleted is
	all that's needed.

	* Removed the "auto unset M_PURGE" when M_DELETED is unset inside
	_mutt_set_flag(), although this is convenient, it easily leads to
	header->purge not being reset in a few situations.

	* Reset purge flag along with the deleted flag if $delete is
	answered no.

	* Set M_PURGE on an edited message. (edit_one_message())

	* Preserve purge flag in mutt_reopen_mailbox()

	* Turn off OPTCONFIRMAPPEND when saving to the trash, rather than
	hardcoding it off in mutt_save_confirm(). That way, normal save to
	the folder will respect the option.

2016-07-16 14:04 -0700  Will Fiveash  <will.fiveash@oracle.com>  (b2cb7a38c1ed)

	* mutt_sasl.c: Fix memory leak in mutt_sasl_cb_pass.

	SASL doesn't free the sasl_secret_t, so this was leaking. Instead,
	keep our own pointer to it, and safe_realloc() each time.

	sasl_secret_t doesn't need the data field null terminated, so memcpy
	the password over.

2016-07-12 18:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (488f91a85115)

	* muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Fix BODY->d_filename memory leaks.

	mutt_message_to_7bit() and transform_to_7bit() were overwriting
	d_filename without freeing the previous value.

	mutt_free_body() was not freeing the d_filename pointer.

2016-07-12 17:46 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4de6941bbb9)

	* muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Fix BODY->charset memory leaks.

	mutt_get_content_info() was directly setting charset without freeing
	the previous value.

	mutt_free_body() was not freeing the charset.

2016-07-11 18:36 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9378d21fc7fe)

	* curs_lib.c, main.c: Initialize mutt windows even in batch mode.
	(closes #3853)

	mutt_select_fcc() calls mutt_addr_hook() -> mutt_make_string() which
	refers to MuttIndexWindow->cols when calling mutt_FormatString(). In
	batch mode, MuttIndexWindow hasn't been initialized, leading to a
	segfault.

	This might be the only overlap, but it seems wiser to just
	initialize the mutt windows in case there are other references (now
	or in the future) when processing format strings in batch mode.

2016-07-08 19:08 -0700  rich burridge  <rich.burridge@oracle.com>  (89ae904a6b30)

	* Makefile.am: Fix conststrings compiler version string generation.
	(closes #3852)

	The Makefile.am tries compiler flags -v, --version, and -V but
	neglected to filter error messages if these flags aren't recognized.

2016-07-08 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ec4c113a3d2b)

	* sidebar.c: Change sidebar highlighted mailbox behavior.

	Delay selecting the highlighted mailbox until prepare_mailbox(), to
	avoid a hidden mailbox being selected during the Buffy list
	population (in mutt_sb_notify_mailbox()).

	Change update_entries_visibility() to not automatically make the
	highlighted mailbox visible.

	Change prepare_sidebar() to (re)set the highlighted mailbox when the
	current highlighted mailbox is hidden.

2016-07-08 18:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5fb53b95afa7)

	* sidebar.c: Fix sidebar pagedown/up when mailboxes on the end are
	hidden.

	The pageup/pagedown code was setting the highlighted mailbox to the
	top and bottom index without checking if those were hidden.

	* imap/message.c: Don't overwrite imap_status->uidnext with a lower
	value. (closes #3771)

	imap_read_headers() updates the idata and imap_status uidnext after
	reading through all the new headers.

	The idata is updated properly (only if its uidnext is below
	maxuid+1), but the imap_status was always being set to maxuid.

	This causes a problem with new mail checking if the most recent
	messages are deleted. Then the uidnext will be greater than maxuid+1
	in the mailbox, and if there are any other unread messages it will
	*always* report new mail even if $mail_check_recent is set.

	* sidebar.c: Fix the sidebar TopIndex and BotIndex when
	$sidebar_new_mail_only is set.

	When set, some of the entries can be hidden, so a simple division by
	page_size to find the correct top/bottom isn't correct.

	Instead, manually partition into groups of page_size visible entries
	and set top and bottom based on the interval around the highlighted
	entry.

2016-07-07 09:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5229c7fbc37e)

	* mbyte.c, pager.c: Filter soft hypen from pager and headers. (closes
	#3848)

	Add U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN to the filtered characters in headers and the
	pager. In some terminals and situations it causes major display
	problems.

2016-07-06 12:31 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (81e9c352e5d7)

	* sidebar.c: Fix sidebar crash for non-existent mailbox

	If you <change-folder> to a non-existent mailbox, there will be no
	Context.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Fix the documented sort methods for
	sidebar_sort_method.

	Remove references to unused "date" and "size", and add "flagged".

2016-07-02 12:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (20089a780e8e)

	* init.c, init.h: Add R_SIDEBAR to redraw sidebar when its settings
	change.

	Add to the sidebar settings that control formatting of the sidebar.

2016-07-02 12:24 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d404059a7619)

	* sidebar.c: Fix sidebar "unsorted" order to match Buffy list order.

	Since the previous commit decoupled the sidebar from the Buffy list,
	we can now restore the order to match the buffy list when
	sidebar_sort_method is set (back) to "unsorted".

2016-07-02 12:22 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b05c170b4c91)

	* buffy.h, sidebar.c: Decouple the sidebar from the Buffy list.

	Change the sidebar to use an array of SBENTRY* instead. Move the
	"is_hidden" into SBENTRY. Remove the added "prev" pointer from
	BUFFY.

	This way, sorting the sidebar doesn't affect the BUFFY list order,
	and we don't need elements inside BUFFY just for the sidebar
	presentation.

	Fix sidebar-next for the case where the mailboxes are unsorted and
	$sidebar_new_mail_only is set. Change sorting not to clump hidden
	mailboxes at the bottom, instead simply skip over hidden mailboxes
	in sidebar-next/prev.

	* doc/makedoc-defs.h: Fix missing sidebar documentation links. (closes
	#3847)

	USE_SIDEBAR needed to be set in doc/makedoc-defs.h so that the
	sidebar option documentation is generated whether mutt is configured
	with the sidebar or not.

2016-06-29 18:58 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4b6829229176)

	* m4/gssapi.m4: Fix cppflags and muttlibs duplication with --with-gss.

	When krb5-config was found, MUTT_AM_PATH_GSSAPI included CFLAGS in
	GSSAPI_CFLAGS and MUTTLIBS in GSSAPI_LIBS. However, configure.ac
	afterwards sets: CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS $GSSAPI_CFLAGS"
	MUTTLIBS="$MUTTLIBS $GSSAPI_LIBS" This caused the flags and libs to
	be duplicated.

2016-06-29 18:58 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c84aa0d62ce3)

	* configure.ac: Include ncurses tinfo library if found.

	Thanks to Fabian Groffen for reporting this issue and providing a
	couple possible patches. From Fabian's report:

	 For some time now, ncurses can be built in a mode where the low
	level terminfo functionality lives in a separate lib called
	libtinfo. Because some people do, this means Mutt needs to include
	this library in that case to avoid linking errors [...]

2016-06-29 12:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b62483975c94)

	* init.h: Clarify oppenc option documention. (closes #3846)

	Rephrase the option description to try and make it clearer what the
	option does, and how to enable/disable it within a message.

2016-06-28 16:06 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2baed7154180)

	* init.h, sidebar.c, sort.h: Remove unused SORT_DESC.

	This came over with the sidebar patch, but I believe is only used by
	the notmuch extension.

	* contrib/sample.muttrc-sidebar: Remove $sidebar_refresh_time from
	Sample Sidebar Config

	The $sidebar_refresh_time option was removed with the changeset
	1f840760e6e0. Remove it from the sample sidebar configuration as
	well, so that anyone using that file in its entirety won't have to
	deal with "unknown variable" errors.

2016-06-23 12:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b45c8ec1e54c)

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, curs_main.c, imap/imap.c, main.c, mutt.h, mx.c,
	pop.c, sidebar.c, sidebar.h: Change sidebar to consistently use
	realpath for context and buffy comparison.

	The original sidebar patch contained a half-implemented attempt to
	use realpath() mailbox paths for comparison. (Presumably so the open
	mailbox remains highlighted despite symlink issues).

	Add realpath to the Context, and set it when opening a mailbox.
	Remove sidebar ifdef for the buffy member, and always set it there
	too.

	Change the sidebar to use the realpath for comparison everywhere.

	mutt_buffy_check() is using stat device and inode for comparison.
	Perhaps this can be changed to use realpath instead, but that's
	beyond the scope of this patch.

2016-06-22 09:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c8613259dc38)

	* sidebar.c: Change sidebar next/prev-new to look at buffy->new too.

	Look at new in addition to msg_unread count, to account for when
	$mail_check_stats is unset or when the sidebar only shows the %n
	status flag.

2016-06-20 20:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3d87b0521a45)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Add documentation to the "New Mail
	Detection" section of the manual.

	Mention the behavior change with $mail_check_recent.

	Add a section about $mail_check_stats.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, imap/imap_private.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h,

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (28688fee52a5)

	* mbox.c, mx.c, mx.h: add mmdf_commit_message function

	Move MMDF operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a
	dedicated mmdf_commit_message function.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (4c6539a88f0a)

	Move mbox operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a
	dedicated mbox_commit_message function.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (16bfe31ef8b3)

	* imap/imap.h, imap/message.c, mx.c: add imap_commit_message function

	Move IMAP operations that were done in mx_commit_message to a

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (37140981e746)

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: add maildir_commit_message function

	This commit adds a maildir_commit_message with a prototype
	consistent with other kind of mailboxes, to simplify upcoming
	refactoring.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (93d4169b0886)

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: prepend maildir_commit_message function name with
	an underscore

	Basically, rename maildir_commit_message to _maildir_commit_message.
	This commit is preparatory to make the maildir_commit_message symbol
	available for further use.

	Symbols starting with underscore should be avoided but this one is
	long enough to prevent collision.

2016-06-18 13:36 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (e5d87ebe0f5b)

	* mh.c, mx.c, mx.h: remove unused HEADER parameter in
	mh_commit_message

	mh_commit_message is only called in one place with the header
	parameter set to NULL. To make the commit function consistent with
	other mailboxes, which only takes ctx and msg as parameters, remove
	this unused parameter.

2016-06-18 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (ce2e5caf4339)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, mbox.c, mh.c,
	mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c: add close_msg to struct mx_ops

2016-06-18 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (4bab14a24dbe)

	* mailbox.h, mx.c: Remove magic member in MESSAGE structure

	The "magic" was copied from the context to the message structure to
	be able to determine which close function had to be called in
	mx_close_message. Now that this function is context aware, there is
	no need to store the magic in the MESSAGE structure and it can be
	safely removed.

2016-06-18 12:41 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (3ec6c133641c)

	* attach.c, commands.c, copy.c, editmsg.c, mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c,
	parse.c, pattern.c, pop.c, postpone.c, recvattach.c, sendlib.c: pass
	context in mx_close_message

	The mx_close_message is one of the few mx_* functions that don't
	have a context as parameter. To make them more consistent, pass the
	context.

2016-06-17 19:01 -0700  Damien Riegel  <damien.riegel@gmail.com>  (70eb7e0dbb58)

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c,
	mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, pop.c, pop.h: Add open_msg to struct
	mx_ops

	Add the callback to open an existing message to struct mx_ops. For
	mbox, mmdf, maildir, and mh, the code was implemented directly into
	mx_open_message, so it is moved in their respective source files.
	For imap and pop, there were already <mailbox>_fetch_message
	functions, but their argument order has been changed to pass the
	context as a first argument.

2016-06-17 10:33 -0700  Olaf Hering  <olaf@aepfle.de>  (d83239fd794a)

	* browser.c, browser.h: folder_file: remove struct stat

	Add and use new flag to indicate the folder is on local filesystem.
	Add and use new gid, uid and nlink member. Use existing ->mode
	member instead of stat->st_mode. Use existing ->size member instead
	of stat->st_size. Use existing ->mtime member instead of
	stat->st_mtime. Remove struct stat, the used values were already
	duplicated in the struct. This reduces memory usage.

2016-06-17 10:33 -0700  Olaf Hering  <olaf@aepfle.de>  (8e671bbe094d)

	* regex.c: Add real prototype for re_match_2_internal in regex.c

	Fixes compilation warning with -Wunprototyped-calls

2016-06-17 10:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5817d3d93b7a)

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, mh.c, mx.h: Combine the basic and extended buffy
	functions.

	Add a check_stats parameter to the mbox, maildir, and mh buffy
	functions. Use that parameter to determine whether to also count
	total, new, and flagged messages.

	This makes the functions a bit more complicated, but improves
	efficiency (for maildir and mh).

	Also includes the following cleanup/fixes:
	* Move the orig-value counter reset to the beginnining of the loop,
	(before tmp->new is set to 0).

	* Change trashed maildir messages to not be counted in msg_count

	* Remove an incorrect setting of mailbox->new based on msg_count in
	maildir. (I missed this one for 1f840760e6e0)

	* Change mbox to use the context->mtime for stats_last_checked,
	removing a race condition.

	* Fix mh to actually count the messages in order to generate
	msg_count. mh_sequences only covers the range of messages with some
	sort of flag.

2016-06-14 13:11 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5ad82360c6ea)

	* imap/imap.c: Reset buffy->new for the current mailbox in IMAP.

	1f840760e6e0 moved the buffy->new reset inside the STATUS processor.
	Since the current mailbox is not STATUS'ed, it needs to be reset in
	imap_buffy_check().

	Thanks to Aaron Schrab for reporting this issue (and for helping
	test tip).

2016-06-12 13:49 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f447c67f511b)

	* OPS.MIX, OPS.SIDEBAR: Fix the case of messages in OPS.MIX and
	OPS.SIDEBAR

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for spotting the discrepancy.

2016-06-07 15:02 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1f840760e6e0)

	* buffy.c, buffy.h, contrib/sample.muttrc-sidebar,
	doc/manual.xml.head, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, init.h, mailbox.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h,
	sidebar.c, sidebar.h: Make extended buffy independent of the
	sidebar.

	Add new boolean option $mail_check_stats (default off) and
	$mail_check_stats_interval. The first turns extended buffy on. The
	second sets the amount of time in between extended buffy checks
	(defaulting to 60 seconds).

	Remove the option $sidebar_refresh_time.

	Change mutt_buffy_check() to only notify the sidebar to redraw if a
	mailbox buffy value changes.

	Remove the #ifdefs around the extended buffy functions. The next
	patch will merge these functions with the basic functions and pass a
	parameter instead.

	Imap is a special case, because it sends out the status in one
	batch. Change this to perform the comparisons inside
	cmd_parse_status() and flag the sidebar there. It was previously
	directly assigning the status counters (unsigned int) to the
	buffy->new (short). Change this to assign 1/0.

2016-06-08 14:43 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4be8b077c81f)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Change the default for sidebar_format
	to use %n.

	The next series of patches is going to create a new option,
	$mail_check_stats defaulting off. When off, the extended buffy which
	calculates total/new/flagged messages won't be run. To help reduce
	"sidebar is broken" bug reports, this changes the default format to
	something not requiring extended buffy.

	The previous default is documented in the option and preserved in
	the sample sidebar muttrc in contrib.

2016-06-08 13:16 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (594137a8ea12)

	* init.h, sidebar.c: Add sidebar_format flag '%n' to display 'N' on

2016-06-09 12:06 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (93c4ae03689e)

	* compose.c: Fix alignment in the compose menu.

	Several of the compose-panel labels didn't use the TITLE_FMT to
	align themselves. This causes formatting problems when the width is
	changed, e.g. by the NNTP patch.

2016-06-08 13:28 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (1fad3bfd4aab)

2016-06-07 13:40 -0700  Richard Russon  <rich@flatcap.org>  (fc33b34d637b)

	* sidebar.c: Setting $sidebar_width to more than 128 would cause bad
	things to happen.

	First, give the users more than enough space. Second, don't pad out
	short strings beyond the buffer

	* commands.c, hdrline.c, pager.c, protos.h, status.c: Fix columns used
	for $status_format and $pager_format in the pager.

	The code was hardcoding use of MuttIndexWindow->cols in
	mutt_make_string_info() and MuttStatusWindow->cols in
	menu_status_line().

	Add a parameter to mutt_make_info_string(). Change
	menu_status_line() to use menu->statuswin->cols, falling back to
	MuttStatusWindow if no menu is passed in.

	Set menu->statuswin appropriately inside pager.c.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for tracking down this problem, and for the
	initial patch.

2016-06-05 18:30 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5270cd795043)

	* mx.c: Fix sidebar buffy stats updating on mailbox close.

	Move the mutt_sb_set_buffystats() call from mx_fastclose_mailbox()
	to the bottom of mx_close_mailbox(). Append-only mailboxes don't
	have msgcount set, so fastclose was the wrong place to be doing
	these updates.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8e342d73159b)

	* buffy.c, mh.c: Start to fix sidebar buffy modifications.

	The extended buffy for mh had incorrect placement of the loop
	brackets. The counters weren't being incremented in the loop.

	Fix extended buffy for maildir to count a maildir message as new if
	it doesn't have the info delimeter.

	Remove shortcircuits added to the basic buffy stating there is new
	mail when (msg_unread > 0). This is not necessarily true, depending
	on $mail_check_recent.

	Note: the extended buffy still needs more fixes, which will be done
	when it is refactored into its own option.

2016-06-04 11:32 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5d117fd810a9)

	* sidebar.c: Various fixes to the sidebar logic.

	Use strfcpy instead of strncpy. The current logic could write past
	the end of the buffer.

	Don't mess with BUFFY next pointers during removal. The
	mutt_parse_mailboxes() is fine, but this is still not something that
	should be done inside sidebar.c.

	On removal, set next->prev since we can.

	Fix unmailboxes logic:
	  * only fix the prev pointers once.
	  * if we unmailbox the open mailbox, set it to NULL.

	Lastly, flag a redraw on mailboxes/unmailboxes.

	* buffy.c, curs_main.c, main.c, menu.c, mx.c, pager.c, sidebar.c,

	Also, remove unused sb_init declaration.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Clean up the sidebar manual.

	Remove the introduction section. It's a nice effort, but reads more
	like a tutorial than something that belongs in section 2. Will
	probably put in on the website instead.

	Remove references to a "patch", neomutt, and the history.

	Remove the sample muttrc from the manual.

	Fix validation errors for the documentation.

	keymap.c, menu.c, mutt_menu.h, pager.c, sidebar.c: Sidebar clean up:
	building and drawing logic.

	Fix the autoconf/makefile.am changes to be consistent.

	Create a global SidebarNeedsRedraw to indicate a redraw is needed,
	instead of putting sb_draw() everywhere in the code.

	Create a menu_redraw_sidebar() function and use the REDRAW_SIDEBAR
	flag instead of piggy-backing it inside the index loop.

	Fix curs_main.c and pager.c to be a bit cleaner by using the global
	and REDRAW_SIDEBAR.

	Start to clean up some of the buffy code, but this needs to
	refactored and fixed.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h, pop.c,
	pop.h: add check operation to struct mx_ops

	In mx_check_mailbox switch case, we simply call
	<mailbox>_check_mailbox, so this operation can be move into the
	mx_ops structure pretty easily.

	This commit adds a mandatory "check" operation to struct mx_ops and
	change all mailboxes to use it. Check functions are made static as
	they are only used in their respective source files now.

	This function is only called in one place with lock = 0. Basically,

	the function simpler to factorize.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mx.c: add function
	imap_check_mailbox_reopen

	In mx_check_mailbox, imap mailbox is the only function with a
	different prototype: it has an extra force argument.

	In order to move the check operation to the mx_ops structure, we
	need that all mailboxes have the same prototype. To do so, a new
	function imap_check_mailbox_reopen is added.

	the open_new_message functions to their respective source files if
	it needs to.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, mbox.c, mh.c, mutt.h, mx.c, mx.h, pop.c,
	pop.h: Start decoupling mailbox operations.

	Introduce a dedicated structure for mailbox operations: struct
	mx_ops. Move the open and close operations into that structure.

	Assign this structure to the context in mx_open_mailbox. This is
	currently based on the "magic" for the mailbox type, but may be
	refactored in the future.

	Add a stub mbox_close_mailbox function. This function does nothing,
	the main purpose is to introduce a mx_ops structure for mbox, so its
	usage is similar to mh/imap/pop. We reuse the name that was made
	available by the previous commmit. Note that the actual closing of
	the descriptor is done in mx.c.

	To be more consistent with other mailboxes, introduce functions
	mh_open_mailbox and maildir_open_mailbox, and create a dedicated
	structure for mmdf.

	* mbox.c, mx.c, mx.h: rename mbox_close_mailbox to
	mx_close_mailbox_append and move it

	mbox_close_mailbox was used as the counterpart of
	mx_open_mailbox_append. To make things clearer, rename it
	mx_close_mailbox_append.

	As it is only used in mx.c, move it there and make it static.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, filter.c: Set COLUMNS to MuttIndexWindow->cols

	This allows filters to automatically (or via a command line
	argument) adjust to the width of the pager/index. This is even more
	important with the sidebar, since the width of the pager is smaller

	decided it would be best to move away from using the "M_" prefix for
	macros.

	and $status_on_top.

	When $pager_index_lines is 1, there is room for the index status
	line, but not for any actual index entries. The index redraw part
	was always calling menu_redraw_current() which doesn't actually
	check if there is room for the current row.

	This bug only shows up with $status_on_top, due to the order things
	are redrawn.

	* pager.c: Fix pager layout when $status_on_top with no mini-index.
	(closes #3836)

	The pager_window->row_offset should only be adjusted when we have a
	mini-index.

	Pull common window initialization above, and adjust only when the
	mini-index is enabled. The pager_window rows and row_offset code
	could be further consolidated (since the status line is always a
	height of one), but I think the code reads a bit more clearly when
	the adjustments are explicitly stated.

2016-04-29 18:00 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e369be9d490b)

	* pager.c: Remove newline insertion from pager. (closes #3835)

	The window patches commited now manually move to the next line, so
	there is no need to insert newlines for that purpose.

	The newlines also goof windows placed to the right of the pager, as
	is the case for the (currently external) sidebar-on-the-right
	functionality.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for the original patch and help testing the
	revised patch.

	Continuing with the conversion to using windows for screen drawing,
	mutt_FormatString() was directly using COLS for right justification
	and similar formatting. Instead pass in a parameter, cols.

	This change involved seeding the parameter through callback
	functions too, as many of them call mutt_FormatString() back.

	* compose.c: Modify the compose screen to use windows.

	The header field positions enum is now started at 0: the windows
	compute the relative positioning as needed. A small improvement from
	this is that the headers now align with the top: there isn't a gap
	if $help is turned off.

	* copy.c, mutt_curses.h, pager.c, rfc3676.c: Modify the pager to use
	windows.

	The pager view is somewhat complex, due to the "mini-index" and the
	positioning of the index_status vs pager_status changes depending on
	$status_on_top as well as $pager_index_lines and $help.

	To make things simpler, it creates four "pager windows":
	index_status_window, index_window, pager_status_window,
	pager_window.

	mutt_term_width() is renamed to mutt_window_wrap_cols() and a
	mutt_window_t parameter passed in.

	Also, the pager drawing loop calling display_line() has a
	mutt_window_move() added to move to the beginning of the next line
	each time. This is in case the pager_window isn't flush with the
	left side of the terminal.

	* curs_lib.c, edit.c, enter.c, protos.h: Modify enter.c routines to

	getcurx.

	* menu.c, mutt_curses.h, mutt_menu.h: Modify the menu code to use
	windows.

	Change menu.c to use the mutt_window_t structures and functions. The
	index/stats/help/message window pointers are stored inside the
	menu_t. This is useful for the pager, where the "index" we want to
	use is a mini-index.

2016-04-27 17:56 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ac4f746e614f)

	* curs_lib.c, init.c, init.h, main.c, mutt_curses.h, resize.c: Add
	window structures to use for screen layout.

	This is a series of 11 patches, centralizing Mutt screen drawing
	inside windows (mutt_window_t structures).

	Currently, the screen drawing and cursor positioning logic is
	distributed all over the code, resulting in many files having the
	same logic of where the help, status, message windows are.
	Additionally, the code directly uses move and mvadd*/mvprint*
	functions, which means if the layouts are changed, the row/column
	computation logic needs to be changed all over the place.

	The patch creates a (very simple) mutt_window_t structure and
	functions for moving, addch/str/printw, along with clearing the
	line. The windows keep track of where they are on the screen,
	allowing the Mutt code to simply position elements relative to the
	window.

	During curses initalization, and when the window is resized, the
	window sizes and positions and recomputed. Also, a new option flags,
	R_REFLOW is added for options that need to force a reflow when they
	are changed.

	Thanks to Richard Russon for pointing out the slang compilation
	issue.

	* muttlib.c: Pre-space softfill multi-column padding.

	Similar to the previous patch, this deals with multi-column padding
	characters and soft-fill. This will add spacing so the padding and
	content after padding aligns with the right side.

	You can see the effect by setting set index_format="%s %*我[ooooo]"
	and resizing the terminal. The right hand side will be jagged
	without the patch.

2016-04-14 12:35 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (fef5b5ed0f44)

	* muttlib.c: Add spacing to truncated multi-column characters when
	using soft-fill.

	First, fix the left-hand side column truncation calculation: "col +
	pad*pw -offset" pad = (COLS - col - wid) / pw, so this becomes "col
	+ COLS - col - wid - offset" => "COLS - wid - offset"

	The problem is that pad was calculated *before* the right side was
	mutt_wstr_trunc() truncated, which may adjust wid! We want that
	calculation, with correct values, so instead just use the final
	reduction directly. (Note, the reduction ignores integer truncation,
	but pad shouldn't be used here in any case, because it's negative:
	there is no padding occuring).

	Second, when the left-hand side is truncated, multi-column
	characters may get chopped in the middle. Truncated characters are
	not included in the wlen and col values returned. Add spaces until
	the number of columns lines up (checking to make sure we don't run
	out of space too).

	retvals.

	While fixing up the error checking for mbrtowc(), I noticed the uses
	in pager.c format_line() were assigning the retval to an int.

	The cleanup for this was a little tricky, because it was making use
	of possible negative values for (k1 - k). The backspace detection
	loop condition was a bit heavy, so this patch first pulled the
	initialization and first call above, and put the second call inside
	the loop.

	Note that k1 previously included k, but this patch changes it to be
	just the retval of mbrtowc. This means the second mbrtowc()
	arguments are changed to include k, as is the ch increment at the
	bottom of the loop.

	* send.c: Check $pgp_autoinline and $pgp_replyinline if oppenc is set.
	(closes #3846)

	The first oppenc call takes place after the initial checks of
	$pgp_autoline and $pgp_replyinline, and doesn't go through the pgp
	menu.

	Therefore, check for $pgp_autoline and $pgp_replyinline if oppenc is
	set too, to avoid oppenc enabling encryption without INLINE being
	set in those cases.

	a6a4d6ed0f19 previously cleaned things up so that it is safe to set
	INLINE even if encryption isn't enabled.

	* keymap.c: Fix infinite loop when help is bound to a named key
	combination.

	Commit a07e8215a0ef introduced a bug in km_error_key, which is
	called when an unbound key is pressed.

	If help is bound to a sequence containing named keys (e.g. <esc>),
	the raw (untokenized) string would be pushed back into the unget
	buffer. This could lead to an infinite loop of unbound key presses
	triggering more unbound keys being put into the unget buffer.

	Change km_error_key to tokenize the string before putting it in the
	unget buffer.

	Much thanks to Jiri Bohac for his bug report, analysis, and initial
	patch!

	* Makefile.am, getdomain.c, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_socket.c, mutt_tunnel.c,
	sys_socket.h: Create a wrapper sys_socket.h to work around Solaris
	namespace issues. (closes #3833)

	Solaris includes "sys/stream.h" inside their "sys/socket.h". This
	include file adds many non-reserved macros to Mutt's namespace, two
	of which conflict with existing Mutt macros.

	The simplest fix would be to rename those macros in Mutt, however
	this will cause difficulty with out-of-tree patches. This fix
	creates a wrapper include file that preserves those existing macros
	and prevents the Solaris values from entering Mutt's namespace.

2016-04-10 16:02 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (a6a4d6ed0f19)

	* crypt.c, send.c: Fix mutt_protect() when INLINE is set. (closes
	#3828)

	The oppenc changes allow security bits to be set even when not
	encrypting or signing (for instance, OPPENCRYPT and INLINE).

	mutt_protect() assumed that if INLINE is set, then either ENCRYPT or
	SIGN must also be set. Specifically, it would end up inline-signing
	the message even though neither was set.

	Ensure mutt_protect() is a noop if neither SIGN or ENCRYPT are set.

	In ci_send_message(), check for sign or encrypt before calling the
	crypt_get_keys() / mutt_protect() block, and also in the fcc section
	(since clear_content would be NULL if not).

	The second change to the fcc part is somewhat redundant, but better
	to be explicit and avoid the case where the subtype is somehow
	"encrypted" or "signed" even though msg->security wasn't set thus.

2016-04-05 14:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (f7db9cefd3b0)

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, mutt_idna.h: Fix IDNA functions for
	systems without iconv.

	The IDNA changes for SMTPUTF8 support introduced a bug for systems
	without iconv. For those systems, the local<->intl functions would
	return an error due to the charset conversion failing.

	Change mutt_idna.c back to being conditionally compiled, but this
	time based on HAVE_ICONV. If there is no iconv, stub out the
	functions in mutt_idna.h.

2016-04-01 09:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (503bd3a3c818)

	* Makefile.am: Fix hcversion.h generation error when using included
	gettext.

	When configuring mutt with --enable-hcache and
	--with-included-gettext, there is an automake ordering issue:
	BUILT_SOURCES are processed before SUBDIRS. Therefore, the
	'hcversion.h' target is run before the included gettext (intl) is
	built.

	The hcversion.h target runs the cpp over config.h and mutt.h, but
	mutt.h includes lib.h which tries to #include <libintl.h>.
	Unfortunately, libintl.h (in this configuration) is generated by the
	intl subdir build and so doesn't exist yet.

	While the build doesn't completely fail, the resulting hcversion.h
	is incorrect: it's just the md5sum of the initial value of
	BASEVERSION.

	This fix is somewhat of a hack but is cleaner than trying to change
	automake's behavior. It inserts a '#undef ENABLE_NLS' in between the
	config.h and mutt.h sent to the cpp. Since hcachever.sh is just
	scanning the data structures used by mutt, this shouldn't affect the
	hash generated.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for reporting this issue.

2016-03-30 13:16 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (6e0aca94cdb0)

	* mbyte.c: Filter out bidi marks in rfc2047 and rfc2231 encoding. (see
	#3827)

	Filter out U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK and U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK
	in rfc2047 and 2231 encoded fields. GNU Screen has a bug that
	corrupts the display, and can cause the wrong email to appear to be
	selected in the index. Until screen fixes the issue, filter it out
	in mutt.

2016-03-29 14:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (96b7714fef87)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Fix documentation: mime_lookup (not mime-
	lookup).

2016-03-29 15:06 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (47aeb87ce9cd)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Fix typo.

2016-03-26 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (62e478a3f1c8)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix error handling in sync_helper() and
	imap_sync_mailbox(). (closes #3817)

	This patch is based on the one Richard Russon found in the Fedora
	package.

	If an error occurs during one of the imap_exec() calls in
	imap_sync_mailbox(), the mailbox could end up being closed. This
	would cause idata->ctx to be NULL. Add a check in sync_helper() for
	the case where idata->ctx == NULL.

	In imap_sync_mailbox(), check the return value of sync_helper(). To
	keep the code simple, change rc from being the sum of the calls to
	the bitwise-OR of the calls. (We only need to know if a single flag
	needs to be updated, and bitwise-OR will detect negatives.)

	Below the calls to sync_helper(), if the call to imap_exec() fails,
	make sure rc is set to -1.

	* imap/browse.c: Prevent renaming root folder in imap.

	The root folder results in mx.mbox being NULL, which causes a
	segfault. This can be triggered by entering a subfolder and trying
	to rename the ".." entry.

	Due to the translation string freeze, no visible error message is
	displayed. Add a TODO note about this for post-1.6 release.

2016-03-23 14:20 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (27cde0a2fe32)

	* imap/browse.c: Fix uninitialized prompt buffer in
	imap_mailbox_rename(). (closes #3819)

	This is a patch from OpenBSD to initialize the newname buffer in
	imap_mailbox_rename(). Previously it would generate random garbage
	in the prompt.

	This version of the patch initializes the prompt to the old mailbox
	name.

	Thanks to TAKAHASHI Tamotsu for finding this patch.

	* curs_lib.c, protos.h: Clean up mutt_wstr_trunc() some more.

	* Change return type to size_t. The return value is the cumulation
	of values from mbrtowc(), which returns size_t. All callers already
	assign the return value to a size_t, requiring no external changes.

	* Change the local variables n, w, l, and cl to size_t. n is the
	strlen of the src parameter. l and cl are used for the return value.
	w is assigned to the *width parameter, which is size_t.

	 cw is kept as an int, because wcwidth returns type int.

	* Change error handling of mbrtowc to be the same as other functions
	in mutt: only reset mbstate when the retval==-1. When retvat==-2,
	set cl=n to break out of the loop. Also, set wc to replacement_char
	and allow the logic below to determine the width instead of
	hardcoding to 1.

2016-03-20 17:06 -0700  Karel Zak  <kzak@redhat.com>  (c8c76a6a1e61)

	* curs_lib.c: Improve error handling in mutt_wstr_trunc().

	This is Karel Zak's patch to fix handling of (illegal) multi-byte
	chars.

	 * mutt_wstr_trunc(): Reset mbstate after error in mbrtowc(). Set
	wc=0 if wcwidth returns < 0.

	Addresses: https://github.com/karelzak/mutt-kz/issues/58

	Thanks to Richard Russon for bringing this patch to our attention.

	The Doctor reported triggering an assertion in convert_file_to(),
	due to an unexpected errno from iconv(). According to the comments,
	the assertions were only enabled for debugging and should have been
	turned off. We certainly don't want to abort mutt for this case, so

	* hcache.c: Fix tcbdb error reporting to use ecode, not errno.

	After committing aff8d62ebddb and taking a closer look at the tcbdb
	documentation, I realized those functions don't set errno.

	Change the error handling messages to instead get the ecode and
	message using tcbdbecode() and tcbdberrmsg().

2016-03-16 13:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (aff8d62ebddb)

	* hcache.c: Fix crash in hcache_open_tc() when open fails and debug is
	on. (closes #3813)

	When the hcache open fails, it was trying to dprint. The dprint had
	a %s where it was passing errno, leading to a crash in strlen.

	Unify the dprint messages for tcdbopen and tcdbclose to report the
	path, strerror, and errno.

	Thanks to Will Yardley for capturing the stack trace!

	* init.h, main.c, mutt.h: Add $resume_edited_draft_files option.

	This adds an extra header when saving edited draft files (-E -H on
	the command line). With this header, the next time they are edited,
	they are automatically "resumed" (by setting $resume_draft_files).

	The idea is to prevent multiple user-defined headers and signatures
	from being added to the draft message by avoiding processing it as a
	brand new message after the first time.

2016-03-08 15:57 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (24b4f14e9538)

	* init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add $resume_draft_files option.

	When set, draft files are processed the same as when resuming
	postponed messages. One use of this option is to avoid multiple
	user-defined headers and signatures being added to the message.
	(e.g. when -E is used repeatedly on the draft files).

	Thanks to Vincent Lefèvre for the memory leak fix.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Add hard redraw for the gpgme application/pgp
	handler.

	Will Yardley reported display artifacts and keyboard issues after
	decrypting a traditional pgp message using gpgme. It turns out the
	gpgpme code path was missing a hard_redraw() to repaint the screen
	after pinentry.

2016-02-28 19:42 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d11b6776532f)

	* main.c, mutt.h, send.c: Draft file tweeks: rename flag, don't auto-
	abort on no change.

	Rename the flag to SENDDRAFTFILE since it will be used in contexts
	other than the body allocation.

	Don't automatically abort if the message was unchanged; it seems
	possible the draft files could be used as the entire message reply.

2016-02-15 19:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (909cf6dd067c)

	* contrib/gpg.rc, crypt-gpgme.c, globals.h, init.h, pgp.c: Add
	$pgp_decryption_okay to verify multipart/encrypted are actually
	encrypted. (closes #3770)

	In pgp classic mode, if the $pgp_decrypt_command generated output,
	it assumed the content was encrypted. However, gpg will generate
	output even if the block is simply signed and armored text. The
	problem is that mutt was then printing mime headers labelling the
	output as encrypted text in the ui.

	Add a new option, and suggested value of: set
	pgp_decryption_okay="^\\[GNUPG:\\] DECRYPTION_OKAY" If set, the
	output from the decrypt command will be scanned for this regexp to
	confirm an actual decryption occurred.

	Note that gpgme already correctly rejects this form of spoofed
	message.

2016-02-11 15:12 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b55c6a64a07b)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Update the status message after decryption using
	gpgpme.

	Change gpgme to behave the same as classic pgp mode: after a

	* postpone.c: Fix pgp and smime decryption in mutt_prepare_template().

	Change the "combined" multipart decryption block to only work for
	pgp, since mutt_is_multipart_encrypted() currently only checks for
	pgp headers and it therefore only worked for pgp in the first place.

	Fix the newhdr->security to be based on what that function returns,
	instead of the "context" hdr passed in.

	Add a smime decryption block below when iterating through the
	content.

	Fix the application/pgp decryption block to assign to hdr->security
	using the type of the app/pgp part instead of hdr->content.

	* lib.h: Increase HUGE_STRING size to 8192. (see #3804)

	The interface for editing a large number of recipients is poor and

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, pop_auth.c, smtp.c: Make sasl authentication
	buffers dynamically sized. (see #3804)

	The reporter found that the current buffer of HUGE_STRING was
	insufficient in his case to encode the clientout response back to
	the server in imap_auth_sasl().

	Since sasl gives us the size of "clientout", we can dynamically
	malloc and resize the buffer as needed. This patch uses
	max(LONG_STRING, (clientoutlen*2)). This is sufficient to hold the
	base64 encoded value plus additional prefix/suffix needed in each
	protocol.

	The size is rechecked after each sasl_client_step() and resized as
	needed.

	Similar code is in pop_auth_sasl() and smtp_auth_sasl(), so convert
	all three to use a dynamic buffer.

	The old parsing code used fscanf, and so happened to allow a tab as
	a delimiter. Even though smime_keys.pl uses a space, some users
	maintain their own .index files by hand (using tab delimiters), so
	continue to allow that delimiter.

	* compose.c: Add a couple missing ATTACHPTR->tree frees.

	While working on ticket 3800, I noticed the tree wasn't being freed
	inside OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HEADERS. Add a free there, and in the cleanup
	at the end of mutt_compose_menu().

	A few other sections in mutt_compose_menu() are performing a free-
	on-error where the tree isn't allocated yet, so skip it for those.

	I believe this is actually not fixing a memory leak: all attachments
	are always at level 0 in the compose menu (as far as I know); so
	nothing is ever allocated in the tree pointer. However since other
	parts of the code in compose.c clean this up, it make sense to add
	them here too.

	* color.c: Prefer bright versions (8-15) of colors for brightXXX
	backgrounds.

	When a bright color is specified as a background, try to use the
	bright version of that color, falling back to the A_BLINK method
	only on terms which do not support enough colors.

	Sample email provided by the submitter showed a Received header with

	the date. The emails are obviously not RFC compliant, but the fix is
	simple enough: find the last ";" using strrchr instead of the first.

	* compose.c: Fix segfault when deleting and reusing attachment slots.
	(closes #3800)

	When attachments are deleted, delete_attachment() slides the entries
	down in the idx array, but forgets to NULL out the last vacated
	slot.

	If more attachments are added later on via OP_COMPOSE_EDIT_HEADERS
	and the Attach: pseudo-header, mutt_gen_attach_list() will attempt
	to re-use the ATTACHPTR in that last slot because it wasn't set to
	NULL. This will be pointing to freed memory and likely segfault (at
	best).

	* mh.c: Fix hash table key "use after free" in mh_check_mailbox().
	(closes #3797)

	The fnames hash uses the maildir->header->path as the key. As
	matches are found, the headers are freed. This inadvertantly also
	freed the key to the hashtable entry; the next hash_find() going to
	the same bucket might end up comparing keys with a freed string.

	This patch stores the path in the struct maildir canon_fname field
	(just as maildir_check_mailbox() does) and uses that as the hash key
	instead. This field isn't used outside of maildir_check_mailbox(),
	and is automatically freed for us in the maildir_move_to_context()
	call at the bottom of both functions.

	Note there are other ways to fix this problem:
	- Add a new mode to the hash table, causing it to strdup the keys and
	free them itself.
	- Delete the entries in the fnames hash, rather leaving them there.
	The first seems the cleanest, but would end up touching much more
	code. The second is also clean, but might have a negative
	performance impact.

	Additionally, peeking back in history to changeset 1d45a50b6f9b, it
	looks like the canon_fname used to be used by mh too, so perhaps
	removing the strdup may have been a mistake during refactoring at
	some point.

	Change mutt_protect() to check for text/plain before trying to
	invoke crypt_pgp_traditional_encryptsign(). This way, mutt can
	provide a bit more specific prompt and error message.

	Since pgp_mime_auto says it will prompt in the event of any failure,
	keep the more generic prompt after the encryptsign call too.

	* crypt.c: Loosen mutt_signed_handler() protocol value consistency
	check. (closes #3639)

	Apparently, for S/MIME, some MUAs mismatch the protocol value of the
	multipart/signed and the content-type of the signature: putting
	"pkcs7-signature" in one and "x-pkcs7-signature" in the other.

	Change mutt_signed_handler() to independently verify the values of
	the protocol and the content-type. This still checks for correct
	values but doesn't ensure they match between the two (for S/MIME).

	* contrib/smime.rc, globals.h, init.h, smime.c: smime: allow signing
	message digest algorithm to be specified.

	Currently, Mutt hardcodes micalg=sha1 for signed messages.
	Unfortunately, the actual message digest algorithm used defaults to
	the value in the "Signature Algorithm" field in the signing key's
	certificate.

	Add a new configuration option $smime_sign_digest_alg, defaulting to
	sha256. Add a new printf format string, %d, to be used in the
	signing command to specify the digest algorithm. Modify the sample
	$smime_sign_command to include "-md %d".

	Note: This solution requires using the modified $smime_sign_command,
	or else the micalg parameter again may not match the algorithm used.
	An alternative solution would be to query the certificate "Signature
	Algorithm" field and try to change the micalg to match it, but this
	method is easier to implement and provides better control for the
	user to configure, in any case.

	Commit 831abf39d53a pulled the mbox_to_udomain() call inside the

	mailboxes to be considered conversion errors instead of just
	skipping them.

	Revert mbox_to_udomain() back to using a static buffer and pull back
	into the mutt_addrlist_to_local/intl() functions.

	imap_browse(). (closes #3646)

	imap_fix_path() removes duplicate and trailing delimiters, so the
	check below it was redundant. This also made it appear list.delim
	could be used uninitialized.

	Remove the check, but add a check to make sure the "fixed" path has
	len>0, to prevent oob accesses of mbox[n-1] below.

	Lastly, remove a redundant n=strlen(mbox) inside the initial LIST
	processing loop. The mbox isn't changed from above, so there is no

	* curs_lib.c, lib.h, pattern.c, rfc2047.c, rfc822.c: Fix possible
	unintentional '\0' strchr matches.

	After fixing the ticket 3787 strchr issue, this patch cleans up
	other potentially incorrect uses of strchr for the '\0' case.

	In mutt_multi_choice(), mutt_getch() can technically return 0.
	Although it seems the user would have to try quite hard to do this,
	it's incorrect to return that index into letters. Change "ch.ch==0"
	to be considered the same as an abort.

	is_email_wsp() is used in a couple places where it wasn't obvious
	whether '\0' was being accounted for, so add an explicit check to
	the function.

	Inside eat_date(), if mutt_extract_token() had no input and returned
	"", the strchr ("<>=", buffer.data[0]) below would return a pointer.
	In actuality, this is prevented by an empty parameter check inside
	mutt_pattern_comp(), but it doesn't hurt to make it the same as
	eat_regexp() and have the check explicitly done here too.

	rfc2047_encode() was another borderline case for adding a check. The
	convert_string() sets a length, so it seems highly unlikely that *t
	could be 0, but doesn't hurt to add the check.

	The find_encoded_word() fix looks necessary. If the passed in s was
	something like "=?charset?" (followed by EOS, '\0'), the
	strchr("BbQq", q[1]) would in fact return a pointer and the
	following q[2] would read past the end of string. If q[2] happened
	to be '?', it might even continue reading in the for loop below.

	Lastly, in parse_mailboxdomain(), the potential overread was already
	fixed in changeset:a6919571eb59, but although the nonspecial and
	special strchr() line happens to "work" for the case of '\0', it's
	pretty fragile to leave as is. It's better to be explicit and just
	return if we hit EOS without calling next_token().

	* rfc822.c: Fix next_token() oob read. (closes #3787)

	With specially crafted input to 'mutt -H', the line "Return-Path:<()
	" is read and passed to mutt_parse_rfc822_line(). "<() " is then
	passed through to rfc822_parse_adrlist().

	Eventually, inside next_token(), is_special(*s) is called when s
	points to the end of the string ('\0'). This macro calls strchr,
	which will actually match and return a pointer to the trailing '\0'
	in RFC822Specials! This causes "s + 1" to be returned, skipping past
	the end of string inside parse_mailboxdomain().

	This patch adds a check to make sure *s is non-null before calling

	separate macro/push/exec event buffer. (closes #3779)

	Currently, the SSL and TLS certficate prompts turn on
	OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT, (to prevent macros and such from running right
	through the dialog). Unfortunately, the menu dialog processing in
	menu_dialog_dokey() is using mutt_ungetch() to forward non-dialog
	keys on to standard menu processing. With OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT set,
	those keys never make it to the menu and are buffered until after
	the menu dialog.

	This patch creates a new event buffer, separate from the standard
	"unget" buffer, for use by macros, exec, and push events. These
	events can be temporarily ignored by setting OPTIGNOREMACROEVENTS
	(renamed from OPTUNBUFFEREDINPUT), while continuing to allow unget
	events to be processed.

	Since the "push" and "unget" functions now go to different buffers,
	function names were slightly renamed, to make it less easy to
	unintentionally use the wrong function at the wrong time.

	prompt. (see #3779)

	The menu type is used in several places as a direct index into
	Keymaps[], so passing in -1 to mutt_new_menu() was leading to
	illegal memory accesses later on.

	Add a range check in mutt_new_menu(), defaulting to MENU_GENERIC, to
	prevent this problem in the future.

	* compose.c: Improve prompt when switching between PGP and S/MIME.
	(closes #3777)

	Only prompt when encrypt or sign is enabled.

	Also, improve oppenc to run and refresh the status when switching.

	* smime.c: Fix chomp in smime_handle_cert_email.

	During a review of the previous patch, Oswald Buddenhagen noticed
	two of the fixed oob reads had another problem: they were "chomping"
	(the newline) without verifying there actually was a newline at the
	end of the string.

	* parse.c, smime.c, smtp.c: Fix oob reads when fgets returns "\0".
	(closes #3776)

	The ticket reported an out of bounds read in mutt_read_rfc822_line()
	when a '\0' was embedded on its own line in the headers. The
	function assumed if fgets() didn't return NULL, then the string
	would have at least one character.

	I scanned the rest of the code and found three other places making
	the same assumption for fgets.

	Thanks to hanno for finding this with the "american fuzzy lop" tool.

	* UPDATING, hdrline.c, init.h, send.c: Add new optional index_format
	expandos %r and %R.

	These generate a comma separated list of all the To and Cc
	recipients.

	Also, increase the attribution buffer size to accommodate these new
	expandos.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Improve translation string in crypt-gpgme.c

	Combine into a single buffer to make the translation easier. Also,
	mark a couple todos for alignment problems.

2015-09-06 16:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2dac9fa02842)

	* imap/browse.c: Fix double-decode during IMAP browse.

	cmd_parse_list() already calls imap_unmunge_mbox_name() on the
	mailbox names returned from the server. However,
	browse_add_list_result() was taking those mailbox names and passing
	them to imap_add_folder(), which was calling
	imap_unmunge_mbox_name() yet again.

	The reason is that imap_browse() was directly calling
	imap_add_folder() too, passing in a previously encoded "mbox" name.
	After looking carefully at the code, I could find no reason that
	mbox needed to be encoded outside of the LIST commands.. Therefore I
	changed imap_browse() to call imap_munge_mbox_name() on mbox for the
	two LIST commands generated from it instead, and removed the
	imap_unmunge_mbox_name() call inside imap_add_folder().

	* mx.c: Fix use after free of ctx->last_tag. (closes #3775)

	When using imap to access gmail, tagging and saving messages to "all
	mail" and pressing <sync-mailbox> can result in the call path:
	mx_check_mailbox() imap_check_mailbox() imap_cmd_finish()
	imap_expunge_mailbox() mx_update_tables() followed by:
	mx_sync_mailbox()

	The HEADER pointed to by ctx->last_tag will be removed and FREE'ed
	in mx_update_tables(), but will subsequently be accessed in
	mx_sync_mailbox().

	This patch simply sets ctx->last_tag=NULL if it is freed inside
	mx_update_tables().

	Thanks to Peter Lekensteyn for the bug report and ASAN report.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Add time_t conversion to fix gpgme segfault on
	OpenBSD.

	time_t isn't the same size as gpgme_subkey_t->timestamp on OpenBSD.
	Passing &subkey->timestamp to localtime was therefore passing an
	address to the wrong size int and was causing a segfault.

	Thanks to Hannes Wenzel for reporting the bug and providing a patch.

	This makes two equivalent translation messages the exact same so

	It also adds a missing translation marker (for the same string).

	This same string is used in recvcmd.c so does not generate a new

	* configure.ac: Add idn to MUTTLIBS instead of LIBS (see #3638)

	Currently, -lidn is included while linking all the mutt binaries.
	Add it to MUTTLIBS instead so it's only used for the mutt linking.

	Also, add $LIBICONV to $LIBS before checking for some of the idna
	functions. On some sytems, there are apparently issues when using
	static linking. (Thanks to grarpamp for reporting).

2015-08-17 12:31 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (356443232291)

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: Change mutt_adv_mktemp to call mutt_mktemp
	instead of mktemp. (see #3638).

	mutt_mktemp is currently called in 95% of the cases in mutt, and is
	already our "own rolled" version of mktemp. The "insecure mktemp
	warning" discussion keeps coming up, so instead add prefix and
	suffix functionality to mutt_mktemp() and call that.

	All other uses of Tempdir in the mutt source did not call
	mutt_expand_path() first, so remove that from mutt_adv_mktemp().

2015-08-17 12:26 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8b2fe6a4db79)

	* configure.ac: Enable C99 mode for compiler. (See #3638).

	This is already the default for clang (FreeBSD) so shouldn't cause
	any issues.

	Enabling this will increase the allowed static string length and
	remove the Copyright length warning.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Minor documentation fix.

	In one place, the documentation mentioned 'alternative-order'
	instead of 'alternative_order'.

2015-07-29 09:07 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (75e398daa94c)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, hook.c: Add error handling for ^ and other
	empty mailbox shortcuts.

	(closes #2402) (closes #3735)

	Explicitly mention the ^ example in the documentation added in
	6d733cab6b45.

	Add an error message for ^ when CurrentFolder is not set. Add checks
	for other mailbox shortcuts that expand to the empty string. This
	could happen if the @alias shortcut was accidentally used, or the
	value referenced by a shortcut isn't set yet.

2015-07-27 14:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (6d733cab6b45)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add "Mailbox Matching in Hooks" section to
	manual.

	Folder-hook and mbox-hook perform mailbox shortcut expansion on the
	regexp parameter. Add a section to the manual to give examples and
	make the behavior clearer.

2015-07-26 14:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (21a08f9abc80)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt.c, handler.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c,
	recvattach.c: Handle malformed ms-exchange pgp-encrypted block.
	(closes #3742)

	In certain circumstances, Exchange corrupts a multipart/encrypted
	block into: <multipart/mixed> <text/plain> <application /pgp-
	encrypted> [BASE64-encoded] <application/octet-stream>
	[BASE64-encoded]

	This patch pulls the full detection of valid/invalid multiparts into
	mutt_body_handler(). It extracts a run_decode_and_handler()
	function, which is reused by new intermediate handlers to decode the
	application/octet-stream part before passing it directly to
	crypt_pgp_encrypted_handler. These intermediate handlers then check
	and set any GOODSIG flags back into the parent part.

	This change may result in less error messages for invalid
	multipart/encrypted parts. Instead, mutt will default to the
	multipart_handler if it isn't fully "correct".

	Viewing attachments uses crypt_pgp_decrypt_mime() which bypasses the
	handler mechanism. Add decoding to the decrypt_mime() functions for
	pgp and gpgme.

	Thanks to Vincent Brillault for his analysis and initial patch.

2015-07-18 18:40 +0200  Martin Sandsmark  <martin@sandsmark.ninja>  (e40e3e0391ea)

	* hcache.c, help.c, imap/util.c, protos.h, sendlib.c: Fix compiler
	type warnings. (closes #3765)

	The output of mutt_local_tz() was being passed to abs(). Technically
	the return type is time_t, but it represents a small value: the
	timezone offset in seconds. Add a safe explicit cast to int.

	Change the txt parameter of mutt_make_help() to type const char *.
	Typically all calls run the txt parameter through _(), which accepts
	const char * and returns a char *. However, if NLS is not enabled,
	_() is a noop, simply returning the parameter itself. In
	mutt_compile_help(), items[i].name is const char *, so it will
	generate a warning when passed as the txt parameter of
	mutt_make_help().

	On some systems, e.g. OS X, snprintf is defined as a macro. One call
	in hcache.c was embedding directives inside the snprintf call. This
	is apparently undefined behavior, so duplicate the call instead.

2015-07-22 19:23 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c60fed102d79)

	* imap/message.c, keymap.c, pop_lib.c: Fix a few small compiler
	warnings. (See #3638)

	In certain configurations, unused variables and labels were causing
	warnings.

	Add a missing "#include <netinet/in.h>" to pop_lib.c.

2015-07-21 12:41 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (704e0622cc67)

2015-07-21 12:34 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e5fe2f80e797)

	* imap/imap.c: Imap: Fix flag caching after sync.

	The flags cached in IMAP_HEADER_DATA were not updated to match the
	HEADER flags after a sync. This means if a flag were toggled and
	synced twice, the second sync was not sending the flag update.

	Thanks to Noah Misch for the patch.

2015-07-19 15:55 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (100835c4a8ac)

2015-07-11 14:36 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2ca89bed6448)

	* main.c: Fix batch mode lockup. (closes #3761) (closes #3760)

	The new TS capability check was also running when curses wasn't
	initialized. Move check inside the !OPTNOCURSES block.

2015-07-09 14:50 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7e91a8855dc3)

	* Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am, imap/Makefile.am: Use $(VAR) instead
	of @VAR@ in Makefile.am files. (closes #3664)

	The @VAR@ form is not overridable, such as the case for #3664 where
	the reporter wanted to override DOTLOCK_GROUP.

	It's doubtful targets need to be overriden, but it makes sense to be
	consistent in the usage of automake substituted variables unless
	there is a particular reason/bug to work around.

2015-07-05 13:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (79cd2f34961d)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Remove 'hit enter' prompt for GPGME initialization
	errors.

	Older GPGMEs are missing CMS (S/MIME) support. Don't force the poor
	users to hit enter every time they start mutt.

2015-07-02 11:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (39422ec14f60)

	* .hgignore, mkinstalldirs: Remove the automake mkinstalldirs script.

	Add to .hgignore so it doesn't accidentally get added again.

2015-07-02 11:21 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (97ef326274e7)

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, contrib/Makefile.am, doc/Makefile.am,
	intl/Makefile.in, m4/gettext.m4, po/Makefile.in.in: Convert from
	using mkinstalldirs to $(MKDIR_P).

	The automake mkinstalldirs script is now deprecated. "install-sh -d"
	can be used in place. Configure.ac already includes AC_PROG_INSTALL,
	which will ensure install-sh is bundled. Add AC_PROG_MKDIR_P, which
	will set $(MKDIR_P) to either a thread-safe "mkdir -p" or will fall
	back to using install-sh.

2015-07-02 11:18 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (67d945e38074)

	* build-release: Fix build-release to always update automake tools.
	(closes #3671)

	1.5.22 and 1.5.23 include a version of "missing" older than the
	version of automake/aclocal used to generate configure.

	Fix the build-release script to always copy and force update of the
	automake tools.

2015-06-29 14:35 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (9802a6172edf)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add note to manual clarifying push/exec and
	folder-hook order.

	Folder-hooks are executed in the order declared. However, push/exec
	commands will simply prepend to the keyboard buffer. If there are
	multiple push/exec commands, each will prepend to the earlier one.
	The result is that they will end up being "run" in reverse order
	once keyboard buffer processing starts.

2015-06-26 12:23 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3bbb1f569eb1)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/imap.c: Fix IMAP segfault due to NULL capstr.

	After a failed login, the connection is left open but capstr is
	freed. If a second login attempt is made, imap_auth_sasl was trying
	to strstr using the NULL capstr.

	Add a NONULL around the capstr parameter to strstr. Change
	imap_conn_find() to keep the capstr around until a successful
	authentication occurs.

2015-06-26 11:38 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4be5796a458)

	* smime.c, smime.h: Rewrite S/MIME key searching. Add purpose
	checking.

	Model the smime.c searching off of classic pgp searching. Create
	smime_get_key_by_hash()/addr()/str() functions that use a single
	smime_get_candidates() function to search the index.

	Use the new smime_keys generated purpose flag in the index to filter
	by KEYFLAG_CANENCRYPT and KEYFLAG_CANSIGN. Old style indices fall
	back to all-inclusive behavior.

2015-06-07 13:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (106914bc9406)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Add refresh command.

	Refresh verifies the trust of each certificate and adds the purpose
	flag if it is missing. It pushes those values to the private keys'
	index file too.

2015-06-07 13:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (aabd030b25cb)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Add purpose flag to index.

	A subsequent patch will change smime.c to use the purpose to filter
	certs and keys that can't be used for signing or encryption.

	Issuer, trust, and purpose flags were also added to the keys index
	file, to keep parsing simpler in smime_keys as well as smime.c. The
	trust and purpose are derived from the cert. Issuer is set to '?' as
	this should never be needed for keys.

2015-05-25 10:59 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (0255b37be491)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Handle certificate chains in add_cert.
	(closes #3339) (closes #3559)

	Find all chains in the certificate provided. For each chain create a
	separate leaf and intermediate certificate file. Because Mutt
	controls the label prompt, use a single label for all chains.

	Also, loosen up cert file parsing to allow attributes even if they
	aren't delimited by a "Bag Attributes" header.

	Thanks to David J. Weller-Fahy for his testing and feedback!

2015-05-18 13:27 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (577987ca2d02)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: Convert openssl execution to use
	open("-|",...). (see #3575) (see #2456)

	This does a fork/exec, bypassing the shell, and so handles spaces,
	quotes, and other shell-characters problems better than the simple
	fix in changeset:c66a6bd5d0d5

	This also fixes the "verify with crl" bug in #2456: the grep is now
	done in perl.

	Thank you Vincent Lefevre for your review and feedback!

2015-05-18 03:25 +0200  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (82d43abf2a37)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation (related to PGP & S/MIME, with
	corrections).

2015-05-15 14:09 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c66a6bd5d0d5)

	* smime_keys.pl: smime_keys: quote filenames. (closes #3575) (see
	#2456)

	Wrap the various filename parameters in single quotes in case there
	are spaces in the filename.

2015-05-15 10:47 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (babc30377614)

	* smime_keys.pl: Start cleaning up and fixing smime_keys.pl (closes
	#3324) (see #2456)

	* Convert to using File::Temp (#3324). This was also suggested at
	https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=775199

	* Use File::Temp for add_p12 temp file. (#2456)

	* Make the query_label() method a bit more robust with empty
	strings, ctrl-d, and leading spaces.

	* Clean up openssl_do_verify() logic. Mark cert as invalid rather
	that die'ing if an openssl verify command fails.

	* General cleanup:
	  - Clearly separate op handler, certificate management, and helper
	functions by section and using prefixes.
	  - Create openssl helper functions to reduce copy/paste invocations and
	make the code clearer.
	  - Make indentation consistent at 2 spaces.
	  - Change handle_add_pem() to re-use handle_add_chain() once the
	correct files are identified.
	  - Change openssl_parse_pem() to return a single array of data
	structures representing the parsed certs/keys.

2015-05-03 16:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c46dfbdb5eff)

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Provide SSL cipher
	selection option. (closes #3167)

	Creates a $ssl_ciphers option that allows direct selection of the
	ciphers for OpenSSL (via SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list) and GnuTLS (via
	gnutls_priority_set_direct).

	Thank you Sergio Gelato for the patch.

2015-04-25 19:00 -0700  Seth Forshee  <seth@forshee.me>  (755a18da99bc)

	* handler.c: Fix performance regression for ~b/~B searching. (closes
	#3743)

	In mutt_is_autoview(), changeset b58cdfacfb89 introduced a call to
	rfc1524_mailcap_lookup() before checking if the MIME type should be
	autoviewed based on the user's preferences. This caused a major
	performance regression for ~b/~B searching.

	Rearrange mutt_is_autoview() to check the user preferences first,
	then search for a mailcap entry only if the MIME type should be
	autoviewed.

	In order to preserve correct mime_lookup behavior, re-add a call to
	mutt_check_lookup_list() before scanning the AutoViewList.

2015-04-19 13:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (067a3ac42c3b)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, mutt.h, pgp.c: Add
	$crypt_confirmhook option. (see #3727)

	Allow the confirmation prompt for crypt-hooks to be disabled. This
	is useful for multiple crypt-hook users (e.g. encrypted mailing
	lists), or just for people who are certain of their crypt-hooks and
	don't want to be prompted every time.

	Thanks to Dale Woolridge for the original patch.

2015-04-19 13:15 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b4c57d3fd7e8)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, hook.c,
	pgp.c, protos.h: Allow multiple crypt-hooks with the same regexp.
	(closes #3727).

	Changes the crypt-hook to accumulate a LIST of hooks with the same
	regexp, as opposed to replacing the hook data. This is useful for
	the case of encrypted mailing lists.

	Update pgp classic and gpgme to process a LIST of crypt-hook values
	instead of just one.

	This version of the patch creates a new _mutt_list_hook() function
	that (in theory) other hooks could use if they were changed to
	return a list. It also changes the behavior when a crypt-hook is
	declined: previously it would immediately use the original recipient
	for key selection. Now it will only do that if all crypt-hooks for a
	recipient are declined. This allows all, a subset, or none of the
	hooks to be used.

	Thanks to Rejo Zenger, Remco Rijnders, and Dale Woolridge for their
	work on various versions of this patch.

2015-04-15 19:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1e26a962ab7a)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Fix a few more incorrect documentation lines
	for hooks.

	Hopefully this finishes up aac979f8b529 and ca5aff2a4b6e.

2015-04-15 18:57 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d12cb775b779)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c:
	Use fingerprints instead of keyIDs internally. (see #3695)

	Add a helper function, pgp_fpr_or_lkeyid(), that returns the
	fingerprint if available, otherwise falls back to the long key id.
	Convert Mutt to use that value for pgp command invocation.

	Change gpgme to use an equivalent crypt_fpr_or_lkeyid() function in
	a couple places too (for keylist generation and sign-as key
	selection).

	Update documentation to mention fingerprints and the --with-
	fingerprint option for gpg invocation.

	Change pgp_long_ids to default: yes, but add a note mentioning it's
	only used for the display of key IDs in a few places.

2015-03-12 14:48 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (bd21cff208c4)

	* recvattach.c: Allow attachments from unencrypted emails to be
	deleted.

	Print a warning if the message is signed or partly signed.

	Thanks to David Haguenauer for the original patch!

2015-04-06 18:39 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ca5aff2a4b6e)

	* doc/muttrc.man.head: Clarify hook pattern vs regexp in muttrc.man
	page.

	Updates to the muttrc.man page were inadvertently not included in
	changeset:aac979f8b529. Fix mbox-hook and crypt-hook to show they
	accept a regexp, not a pattern.

2015-04-05 13:52 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e3e6febd8240)

	* contrib/smime.rc: Fix smime.rc typos and spacing issues. (closes
	#3745)

	Thanks to David J. Weller-Fahy for that patch.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (1bd26d871d76)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix const errors caused by find_keys() changes.

	Part 4 of the oppenc series changed the keyID type to const as part
	of some cleanup changes. At the time, that only propagated to
	crypt_getkeybystr(), but with the fingerprint changes, this is
	starting to propagate too far.

	Create a separate non-const variable to deal with the crypt hook
	value and revert crypt_getkeybystr()'s parameter to non-const.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b8ead28d8e84)

	* compose.c, crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c, smime.c: Add ui elements for oppenc
	mode.

	Add a status message to the Security line when oppenc is enabled.

	For each send menu, add the ability to toggle it on or off. When
	enabled, the menus won't show the (e)ncrypt or (b)oth options, and
	the (c)lear function only clears the SIGN bit when it is active.

	Change the gpgme_send_menu() to directly use the ENCRYPT and SIGN
	flags instead of the PGPENCRYPT/SIGN and SMIMEENCRYPT/SMIME flags.
	Using the latter sometimes resulted in the APPLICATION bit unset,
	which made oppenc unhappy.

	The send_menus previously used a switch statement using choice
	numbers. Since the menus now vary based on the oppenc option and
	message bit being set, these were all changed to convert the numbers
	back to a choice letter.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2ec6a8d91de4)

	* crypt.c, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, postpone.c, send.c, sendlib.c: Add a
	security bit to the message for oppenc mode.

	This allows oppenc to be enabled/disabled on a message level. If
	something initially enables encryption, such as crypt_autoencrypt or
	crypt_replyencrypt, oppenc is turned off for the message.

	Change the postpone/resume code to persist the oppenc bit.

	Also change resend message to enable and invoke oppenc if the option
	is set.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b38c4838976f)

	* compose.c, crypt.c, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add the
	crypt_opportunistic_encrypt option and calls.

	This patch creates the OPTCRYPTOPPORTUNISTICENCRYPT option and
	documentation.

	It also adds calls to crypt_opportunistic_encrypt() during initial
	message composition, after updating to, cc, or bcc, and after
	editing the message (if edit_headers is enabled).

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b10d0a945623)

	* crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, send.c: Implement
	crypt_opportunistic_encrypt().

	This function will be called to flip encryption on and off based on
	message recipients.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (db2abe57adb5)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c, smime.c: Implement
	oppenc_mode in the find_keys methods.

	oppenc_mode is used by crypt_opportunistic_encrypt to determine
	whether there are valid keys for all recipients of a message,
	without prompting the user.

	The patch wraps around prompts, and makes getkeybyaddr methods
	return a valid address-matching key without prompting.

	The patch also fixes a small problem with gpgme's getkeybyaddr. When
	determining if there were multiple strong matches, it was comparing
	the crypt_key_t instead of its kobj member (gpgme_key_t).

	The patch also enables a call to crypt_is_numerical_keyid() in
	find_keys(), so that crypt-hooks can actually be checked without
	prompting when gpgme is enabled. (The addition was patterned off of
	the pgp_findKeys() function).

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (80b963ff82d3)

	* crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c: Pull is_numerical_keyid() into
	crypt.c.

	A subsequent patch (re?)-introduces a call to is_numerical_keyid
	inside find_keys(). Rather than duplicate the function, this patch
	pulls it into crypt.c, where find_keys() and pgp_findKeys() can both
	call it.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (04eb395d80a7)

	crypt-mod.h, crypt.c, cryptglue.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c, pgp.h,
	smime.c, smime.h: Introduce an oppenc_mode parameter

	It's added to the parameter lists through the call stack down to the
	find_keys calls.

	No functionality is implemented yet. This patch is separated just to
	keep other patches more readable.

2015-03-30 15:45 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5b443e7da81b)

	crypt-mod.h, crypt.c, cryptglue.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgp.c, pgp.h,
	smime.c, smime.h: Refactor the address list generation out of the
	find_keys routines.

	All four find_keys routines have a similar set up code for
	generating a single address list out of the to, cc, bcc lists. This
	patch pulls all the code into crypt_get_keys.

	This is done to simplify the functions before later patches make
	them more complicated (with the oppenc_mode parameter).

2015-03-17 16:28 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (59bd9030e898)

2015-03-17 16:28 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ab101844dc07)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add entries for =B and =h in pattern modifier
	table.

	Since these operate differently for IMAP, it's worth adding explicit
	entries to the table for these two.

2015-03-17 16:28 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (aac979f8b529)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Clarify hook documentation to specify regexp
	instead of pattern.

	Account-hook, crypt-hook, and mbox-hook accept a regexp parameter,
	not a pattern.

2015-03-04 19:24 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (09be71b645a7)

	* pgp.c: Fix pgp_application_pgp_handler to remove all tempfiles.

	If multiple PGP blocks are present in an email, Mutt only cleans up
	the tempfiles for the last block. Thanks to Dennis Preiser for the
	patch and sample mbox file demonstrating the problem.

	This patch also fixes the argument to mutt_perror for the pgpout
	tempfile.

2015-02-10 18:29 +0100  Peter Wu  <peter@lekensteyn.nl>  (70b85d8b232b)

	* sendlib.c: Fix buffer underread for empty header values. (closes
	#3736)

	When a header has no value (*p == '\0' so l == 0), do not read
	outside the buffer but print the newline anyway when a tag is
	already printed (col != 0).

	Caught by ASAN while opening a draft with no Subject.

2015-02-11 21:38 +0100  Eike Rathke  <erack@erack.de>  (f5b1b75c5958)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt.c, mutt_crypt.h, pgpkey.c: Allow fingerprint
	user input for key selection. (see #3695)

	Accept and check input of a fingerprint and find the matching key.

	Note that for both to work, match against and display of
	fingerprint, the pgp_list_pubring_command and
	pgp_list_secring_command need to contain the
	--with-fingerprint option, or have with-fingerprint in
	~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.

2015-02-15 10:09 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (af5951f5d81c)

	* contrib/gpg.rc, gnupgparse.c: Add fingerprint record parsing for pgp
	list keys. (see #3695)

	Modify parse_pub_line to parse fpr records and add the fingerprint
	to the pgp_key_t's fingerprint field.

	Add "--with-fingerprint --with-fingerprint" to the
	pgp_list_pubring_command and pgp_list_secring_command commands in
	contrib/gpg.rc. The second invocation generates fpr records for
	subkeys too.

2015-02-15 10:08 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (47b4e57b2f1c)

	* pgplib.c, pgplib.h, pgppubring.c: Convert pgp_key_t fingerprint to a
	char* (see #3695)

	Currently only pgppubring.c is using the fingerprint field, and is
	using it to store a binary version of the fingerprint.

	Convert the field to store a null-terminated string. Modify
	pgppubring.c to use to use the new field.

2015-02-10 12:14 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (385d7434c9d6)

	* pgpkey.c: Protect addr with NONULL in pgp_getkeybyaddr.

	This was introduced by bb3b01f41ed2, but wasn't included in the
	NONULL checks added in 9a75aa4bd69e.

2015-02-08 14:19 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (addd7cea01d4)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Cache uid validity in crypt_key_t.

	In order to find the validity for a crypt_key_t, the code has to
	loop through the key->kobj->uids list up to the correct index. This
	is a bit silly since the uid is available when the crypt_key_t is
	created in get_candidates().

	This patch adds a validity field, and changes the various places to
	use that instead of looping.

	Also fix a bug in _crypt_compare_trust(): it was using the validity
	of the first uid instead of the corresponding uid's validity.

2015-02-08 13:44 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (7162033d1fb8)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix pgp-gpgme to set revoke/expired/disabled flags.

	The code wasn't settings those flags in get_candidates(). This patch
	adds it to the pgp path. I don't know if these flags apply to SMIME
	so am leaving them out for the smime branch.

	Fix up crypt_select_key() to follow the same logic as
	pgp_select_key().

2015-02-03 15:39 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (2fd1b9f17b80)

	* contrib/smime.rc, init.h: Change the smime_encrypt_with default to
	aes256.

	Openssl supports -aes256 at least since 2004, and it's a stronger
	algorithm than des3.

	Also:
	- Remove the incorrect documentation comment about defaulting to 3des
	if unset.
	- Change the default set in contrib/smime.rc.

2015-02-04 11:04 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (d2f5832a9e68)

	* send.c: Protect SmimeDefaultKey for postpone/resume.

	PgpSignAs is saved and restored in ci_send_message(), but
	SmimeDefaultKey was not.

	Also, fix a bug where an empty PgpSignAs was not restored back to
	empty if the postponed email contained a SignAs value.

2015-02-02 13:25 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (3f4dc0ce66ae)

	* postpone.c: Fix mutt_parse_crypt_hdr() sign_as behavior.

	Currently, if a message is postponed with only the E encryption
	flag, when it is resumed, pgp_sign_as will be overwritten (with an
	empty string).

	This intention of the behavior was probably to restore the exact
	state of pgp_sign_as upon resuming. However, if the message wasn't
	marked for signing, the state of pgp_sign_as is not known. This
	patch changes the mutt_parse_crypt_hdr() to only set an empty
	pgp_sign_as if there is an S flag (and if set_empty_signas is true).

	mutt_edit_headers() also uses the function, but it doesn't want to
	overwrite pgp_sign_as with just an S flag. The set_signas parameter
	is renamed to (a hopefully clearer) "set_empty_signas".

2015-01-15 14:18 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (688d66ae6014)

	* imap/message.c, mailbox.h, mx.c, sendlib.c: Send the IMAP \Draft
	flag when postponing a message.

	This patch adds a mx_open_new_message() flag, M_SET_DRAFT. It also
	adds a MESSAGE->flags.draft flag.

	mutt_write_fcc() passes the M_SET_DRAFT flag to
	mx_open_new_message(), which then sets MESSAGE->flags.draft. Then,
	imap_append_message() is able to see this flag and so adds the
	\Draft flag.

	The imap_append_message() function started to have a bit too many
	flags, so this version of the patch separates out the flag
	generating code into a simpler version.

2015-01-29 15:40 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (282832c0329a)

	* mutt_sasl.c: Clean up sasl warnings.

	These were caused by assigning callback functions to the
	sasl_callback_t.proc member. The callback type doesn't list any
	parameters, because parameters vary by callback. The fix was simply
	assigning a cast.

	Cyrus-sasl2 has a sasl_callback_ft typedef that their sample code
	uses for this purpose, but it is in a different header, saslplug.h,
	and isn't in their 1.5 tree. Since this is probably not portable to
	other implementations, I just added an equivalent cast.

	* configure.ac, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Clean up gnutls warnings.

	Most of the warning were caused by deprecated types:
	gnutls_certificate_credentials gnutls_certificate_status
	gnutls_datum gnutls_digest_algorithm gnutls_session
	gnutls_transport_ptr gnutls_x509_crt Even though I believe the
	replacements have been around for a while, the patch adds autoconf
	checks and fallback typedefs.

	One warning was caused by casting an int to a pointer for the second
	parameter to gnutls_transport_set_ptr(). Recent gnutls has a
	replacement gnutls_transport_set_int() macro, but this macro simply
	(eventually) casts the parameter using
	"(gnutls_transport_ptr_t)(long)". So this patch just does the same.

2015-01-25 18:09 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (df55f14f4585)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, init.h, pgp.c: Remove GPG_AGENT_INFO check for GnuPG
	2.1 compatibility. (closes #3715)

	GnuPG version 2.1 stops exporting the GPG_AGENT_INFO environment
	variable, so mutt can't check for the presence of that to ensure the
	agent is running.

	For GPGME, we can check for the OpenPGP protocol being present. For
	classic pgp, we have to trust the user setting.

	This patch is based on the patches sent by CustaiCo and muffins.
	Thank you both for reporting the problem and creating a patch.

2015-01-23 10:33 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (ec93761e3e12)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt-mod-pgp-gpgme.c: Implement mail-key, Esc-K, for
	gpgme. (closes #3488)

	This patch implements the make-key-attachment function for gpgme,
	modeled after the pgp version.

	It also adds an optional tempf parameter to
	data_object_to_tempfile() so the function can be reused for make-
	key-attachment.

2015-01-19 15:58 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (b39219ffe75b)

	* pgpkey.c: pgp_getkeybystr: Pull key matching out of the address
	match loop.

	Since the key is invariant inside the address loop, there is no need
	to match against it with each address.

	All the keys should have at least one address record (see
	bb3b01f41ed2), but in case a record was malformed, add a check for
	that to keep the same logic.

2015-01-21 10:14 +0100  Eike Rathke  <erack@erack.de>  (5d7345b4c516)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: HEAD is dead, remove wrong instruction from doc
	/devel-notes.txt

	Branch HEAD was closed over a year ago. If one was following the
	instruction to update -C HEAD you'd end up with an empty source tree
	and had to checkout the default branch again.

2015-01-18 17:50 +0100  Eike Rathke  <erack@erack.de>  (6e5a62946141)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Allow short and long key ID user input in
	crypt_getkeybystr()

	The following did not work, e.g. when leaving a key list, and at the
	"Sign as" or "Encrypt to" prompt attempting to enter a key ID:
	* set pgp_long_ids=no
	  * enter a long key ID, with or without leading 0x
	* set pgp_long_ids=yes
	  * enter a short key ID without leading 0x

	Specifically entering a long key ID should always be possible as
	evil32.com has shown.

	This also cleans up the logic used to determine the matching
	condition, which was quite convoluted.. it even slightly speeds up
	the loop as less string operations are involved in the inner
	condition.

	This only changes how the result obtained from the crypt_* gpgme
	interface is filtered.

2015-01-18 17:45 +0100  Eike Rathke  <erack@erack.de>  (63ad7cf0d0de)

	* pgp.c, pgp.h, pgpkey.c: Allow short and long key ID user input in
	pgp_getkeybystr()

	The following did not work, e.g. when leaving a key list, and at the
	"Sign as" or "Encrypt to" prompt attempting to enter a key ID:
	* set pgp_long_ids=no
	  * enter a long key ID, with or without leading 0x
	* set pgp_long_ids=yes
	  * enter a short key ID without leading 0x

	Specifically entering a long key ID should always be possible as
	evil32.com has shown.

	This also cleans up the logic used to determine the matching
	condition, which was quite convoluted.. it even slightly speeds up
	the loop as less string operations are involved in the inner

	line interface is filtered.

2015-01-17 14:34 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (58a9dbfd0d25)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix some context, data, and key memory leaks in
	gpgme.

	The context and data cleanup just involved adding missing
	gpgme_release() and gpgme_data_release() calls in a few places.

	The key usage was a little more involved:
	  * Fix crypt_free_key(). It wasn't freeing the key passed in, and
	didn't work properly if multiple keys were passed in. It also was
	missing a call to gpgme_key_unref().

	 * Add free_recipient_set() to properly unref all the keys before
	freeing the array.

	 * Fix get_candidates() to ref keys added to the crypt_key_t list,
	and unref the keys returned by gpgme_op_keylist_next().

	 * Change usages of gpgme_key_release() to gpgme_key_unref(). The
	former was deprecated in gpgme version 0.4.1 (2003-06-06).

2015-01-17 14:42 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cc7903944687)

	* hcache.c: Fix the hcache type punning warning.

	This patch fixes the type punning warning by switching from (safe
	but perhaps not elegant) casting to using a union.

	Thanks to Vincent Lefevre for his input and suggestion to use the
	union as a better solution to the problem!

2015-01-15 13:19 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.net>  (d732298789f2)

	* curs_lib.c: Also colorize the initial mutt_enter_fname prompt.

	Note: the new prompt obtained after a key is typed was already
	colorized.

2014-08-12 14:04 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4ba366bc7c45)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, enter.c, history.c, history.h: Add a scratch
	buffer to the history ring. (closes #3082)

	This patch creates an extra slot in the history ring for a scratch
	buffer (at h->last). If you are editing inside that buffer, it is
	preserved when you scroll up/down through the history. Editing while
	in other places in history are *not* preserved with this patch.

	Another behavior change worth noting with this patch: the position
	in history is now reset to the scratch buffer after each input
	entry. Before, the position would be stay wherever it was - you
	didn't restart at the "bottom" each time.

2013-11-06 13:07 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (8a2d9d352e2c)

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add option to encrypt postponed
	messages. (closes #3665)

	This patch is based on Christian Brabandt's patch sent to mutt-
	users.

	Add two new configuration variables: $postpone_encrypt and
	$postpone_encrypt_as. When $postpone_encrypt is set and a message is
	marked for encryption, the message will be encrypted using the key
	specified in $postpone_encrypt_as before saving the message.

	In this patch, $postpone_encrypt_as must be specified. I
	experimented with passing safe_strdup( NONULL (PostponeEncryptAs))
	when unspecified, but although gpg.conf has a default-key setting, I
	could not get it to work properly. (pgpclassic gave an error message
	and gpgme sefaulted.)

	Although not necessary, this patch turns off signing during
	encryption of the postponed message (and turns it back on before
	saving), since there is no need to sign the message yet.

2015-01-09 14:22 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (25430a489665)

	* color.c, contrib/colors.default, contrib/colors.linux, curs_lib.c,
	doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, mutt_curses.h: Add color
	type for prompts.

	This adds a new color type, MT_COLOR_PROMPT, that can be used to
	colorize prompts (fields, yes/no, multi_choice).

	Thanks to Ben Boeckel for the patch!

2013-10-29 18:25 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (789501922727)

	* crypt-gpgme.c, pgp.c: Add gpg signature name. (closes #3478)

	Some mail clients display "noname" for the gpg signature attachment.
	This patch sets the mime name to "signature.asc".

	The patch is based on http://dev.mutt.org/trac/attachment/ticket/347
	8/gpg_signature_name.patch with the changes:
	  - removes the configuration options
	  - removes mime description

2015-01-06 14:38 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (cd57f8893b43)

2014-12-31 20:35 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (31ce789af3df)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix segfault of extract-keys (^K) under gpgme.
	(closes #3698)

	This patch is based on the patch by Ben Price, which relocated the
	safe_fclose (&in) after its use by keydata in
	pgp_gpgme_extract_keys. Thank you for the patch!

	In addition, this patch:
	  * removes spurious (debug?) output when the extract keys is finished.
	  * adds a gpgme_data_release() call to free the keydata.

2014-10-10 14:17 +0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (e7a77a6bfb84)

	* query.c: Fix a memory leak in mutt_query_complete.

	When a single result was returned, it was written to the buffer and
	returned, but the query result was never freed.

	This patch creates a free_query function and changes the code to use
	that everywhere.

2014-08-14 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (c7f116b6dc20)

	* configure.ac: Fix variable name in configure.ac.

	$ac_cv_search_STRINGPREP_CHECK_VERSION should be
	$ac_cv_search_stringprep_check_version, to match the first parameter
	of the AC_SEARCH_LIBS([stringprep_check_version] above.

	Running configure was giving a "test: =: unary operator expected"
	error.

	* sendlib.c: Revert write_one_header() to skip space and tab. (closes
	#3716)

	This patch fixes CVE-2014-9116 in the stable branch. It reverts
	write_one_header() to the pre [f251d523ca5a] code for skipping
	whitespace.

	Thanks to Antonio Radici and Tomas Hoger for their analysis and
	patches to mutt, which this patch is based off of.

2015-01-05 18:28 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (5a86319adad0)

	* pgpkey.c: Fix segv in pgp_getkeybystr(). (closes #3725)

	When searching for keys, and the user supplies "" to match against,
	pgp_getkeybystr will have values: p = ""; l = 0; After returning
	from pgp_select_key(), it will try to assign to p[l-1].

	(As a note, the function is chopping off and restoring the trailing
	"!" character because of ticket #1928.)

2015-01-03 11:33 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (79ea10b2d81c)

	* commands.c: Change bounce to use mutt_parse_adrlist() for address
	parsing.

	When prompting for recipients, forwarding, replying, and mailing all
	use mutt_parse_adrlist() to parse the addresses. This allows for
	addresses to be separated by spaces.

	Bounce message currently uses rfc822_parse_adrlist(), which doesn't
	allow the spaces. This one-line patch simply changes bounce to
	behave the same as mail, reply, and forwarding for the address
	prompt.

	Thanks to Roger Cornelius for the patch!

	* gnupgparse.c, pgpkey.c: Wrap pgp_uid_t->addr in NONULL(). (closes
	#3564)

	The previous patch introduced the possibility for addr to be null.
	Mutt is surprisingly robust against null strings, but there are a
	few places that should be wrapped in NONULL().

2014-08-12 14:33 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (bb3b01f41ed2)

	* gnupgparse.c: Fix parse_pub_line to allow an empty User-ID field for
	a pub record. (see #3564)

	A key whose primary uid record has an empty User-ID will result in
	the user being unable to use the key to encrypt an email in mutt.
	This is because the mutt functions for key selection iterate through
	the address fields of a key for matching against and for displaying
	to the user.

	This change allows a pgp_uid_t record to be created for a pub record
	whose User-ID field is blank. So the key will have one address
	record, albeit with a null addr field.

2013-11-02 20:12 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (4909bd9c9149)

	* main.c: Override draft headers with arguments. (closes #3580)

	Currently, if the -H option is used, it is not possible to redefine
	the recipient addresses with positional argument. This patch fixes
	it as well as CC, Bcc, and Subject headers.

	This patch is based on the patch by Petr Písař at http://dev.mutt.or
	g/trac/attachment/ticket/3580/override_draft_headers_with_arguments.
	patch

	This version of the patch merges the To, Cc, and Bcc commandline
	arguments into the template, and fixes a few small problems with the
	previous patch.

	This patch also moves the fin close outside the "if (tempfile)"
	block, since it is opened outside that block.

2014-06-21 13:51 -0700  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (daf61444d454)

	* pgpinvoke.c: Enable %a format string for all pgp command configs.
	(closes #3699)

	Currently, the documentation states that, with the exception of
	pgp_getkeys_command, all the PGP format commands should be available
	to the pgp_*_command configuration variables.

	However, the %a format is actually only enabled for
	pgp_clearsign_command, pgp_encrypt_sign_command, and
	pgp_sign_command.

	Philip Rinn discovered this problem when he was trying to add a
	"--encrypt-to %a" to pgp_encrypt_only_command. Rather than just fix
	the one configuration he was having the problem with, this patch
	enables %a usage for all of them. (With the exception of the
	documented pgp_getkeys_command.)

2013-12-18 19:19 -0800  Kevin McCarthy  <kevin@8t8.us>  (630bbc147022)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Note correct usage of $edit_headers. (closes
	#3673)

	Ticket 3673 shows that it isn't necessarily obvious a blank line is
	needed between the headers and body of a message when using
	$edit_headers. This patch adds a small note to the documentation,
	indicating the blank line should be preserved between the headers
	and body.

	Thank you Sinan Kaan Yerli for the patch.

	* postpone.c: Fix postpone/resume to not remove a Mail-Followup-To
	header (closes #3070)

	This solution changes mutt_prepare_template() to check whether the
	message_id field is NULL to decide whether to wipe the message-id
	and mail-followup-to headers when instantiating the message.

	If we are resending a message, we don't want the previous message-id
	and mail-followup-to headers. If we are resuming a postponed
	message, however, we want to keep the mail-followup-to header if any
	was set before the postpone. (grafted from

	Unknown or invalid macro. That is, one that does not fit in the

	incorrectly.

	Use local definitions of .EX/.EE or .DS/.DE to avoid low-level troff
	requests in the page body. There are plans to add these to groff
	man; in the interim, this patch adds a compatible definition to your
	page.

	* attach.c: Fix segfault when viewing text attachments in compose
	menu. (closes #3644)

	The segfault was introduced in changeset b9f9e3147eb4. Since
	decoding and charset conversion aren't needed for attachments when
	composing a message, this patch reverts to just using
	mutt_save_attachment() to view "raw data" for text attachments in
	the compose/send case.

	This patch is based on Michael Elkins' patch at http://dev.mutt.org/
	trac/attachment/ticket/3644/view_attach_compose_segfault with just a
	missing return value check added.

	* commands.c, hook.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Ensure that BUFFER

2013-10-05 19:25 +0000  Aaron Schrab  <aaron+mutt@schrab.com>  (132861c8b4e9)

	* commands.c, hook.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c,
	init.c, keymap.c, pattern.c, score.c: Consistently use
	mutt_buffer_init function

	Despite the existence of the mutt_buffer_init function, most
	initializations were instead done with memset. Use the specific
	function instead to make it easier if later changes are made to how
	the initialization should be done.

	* pager.c: Don't exit pager if quit=ask is answered "no".

	This patch addresses ticket 2788.

	Currently if you quit ('Q') from inside the pager, with quit=ask-yes
	or quit=ask-no, and you respond "no", mutt leaves you back in the
	index menu.

	This patch changes it so that mutt does not exit the pager.

	* version.sh: restore ability for version.sh to cope with a repository
	directory with a space in it.

2012-12-27 20:33 -0800  Aaron Schrab  <aaron@schrab.com>  (13c9a5d820f2)

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Use the directory where the version.sh
	script is located as the directory where it is run. Since this will
	be run in a separate shell anyway, there's no need to worry about
	changing current directory.

	This eliminates the need for the caller to specify where the source
	directory is located, and doesn't require that the code take special
	care to use the appropriate directory. The fallback method of using
	`cat VERSION` was broken in this respect, it would not work when run
	from a different directory.

	* .hgignore, Makefile.am, main.c, muttbug.sh.in, txt2c.c, txt2c.sh:
	Add compiler and configure info to mutt -v output (closes #3537)

	Makefile(.am) updated to produce conststrings.c, which contains C

	* the compiler's own version information;
	* the CFLAGS value from the Make environment
	* the ./configure options

	main.c is updated to print them when running 'mutt -v'.

	txt2c.sh is added to produce conststrings.c. txt2c.sh uses a
	compiled txt2c binary if possible, for complete fidelity to the
	source strings in whatever encoding they may use. If txt2c is not
	available (could not be compiled, or was not compiled natively) it
	falls back on a shell function to approximate the output using sed
	and tr.

	Many structs used in mutt are actually constant but are defined
	without the 'const' keyword. This can slow initialization (slightly)
	in some environments due to extra copying and increases the amount
	of writable RAM required at run-time, which can be significant on
	non-MMU systems. Using const can also increase the opportunities for
	compiler optimization.

	The attached patch marks many such structures as const. On my test
	x86 build, this reduces the size of .data by over 50%.

	1. Enable header caching in muttrc 2. Set spam rules in muttrc 3.
	Use IMAP (or POP or Maildir). Your spam rules store spam tags into
	your message headers, and these get cached. 4. Quit mutt 5. Change
	your spam rules in muttrc 6. Relaunch mutt 7. Because of header
	caching, the rfc822 headers are not reparsed, and spam rules are
	not reapplied. User has outdated spam tags.

	Spam rules are applied during rfc822 header parsing because it's the
	only time we get a full and unadulterated view of all headers. Once
	header parse is done we have only processed headers and 'user
	headers' (X-headers). We might do spam rule matching against the
	struct HEADER copy of headers, except that:

	a. the header might not be in HEADER if it's non-standard and not an
	X-header; b. spam rules are regular expressions matching any
	arbitrary header line, and we would need to map these regexps to
	the header used to create the HEADER fields. This would change
	the syntax and behavior of spam rules dramatically.

	One solution, perhaps stopgap, is to invalidate the header cache
	when spam rules change. That's what this patch does. It alters the
	hcache versioning algorithm so that in addition to using the
	compiled-in checksum of mutt's structures definitions, we also mix
	in the user's runtime spam rules. Any time spam rules change the
	hcachever hash value changes, causing the hcache to be rewritten.

	* version.sh: version.sh: fix(?) failure due to bizarre sh quoting
	rules

	I have not checked POSIX, and sh quoting always makes my head hurt,
	but this seems to suffice for my sh (actually bash in sh mode) when
	HGROOT contains a space.

	* configure.ac, dotlock.c, mutt.h, version.sh: Extra information in
	mutt version string, redux.

	Restores [f1b4d1d17200] functionality with a slight change to keep
	'make dist' working (see backout in [6b38124a5b81]).

	Automake is too much voodoo for me at this time, so I let it keep
	VERSION. mutt.h defined MUTT_VERSION as VERSION and the code used
	that, so I removed MUTT_VERSION from mutt.h and put it into config.h
	via configure.ac. A couple of tweaks were needed elsewhere. This
	restores the fancy-versioning feature within mutt and keeps 'make
	dist' happy.

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Back out f1b4d1d17200. It is nice, but it

2011-01-03 13:19 -0600  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (b107737c415c)

	* patchlist.sh: Include mq-based patches in the mutt patch list.

	This augments the contents of the PATCHES file, so that mq-based
	builds do not need to maintain that file.

	* configure.ac, version.sh: Include extra information in mutt version
	string for developer builds.

	When a build is based on an hg clone, include extra information
	about the changeset node, distance from a tagged release, and mq
	applied patch count.

	For example, after this patch is applied my mutt build identifies
	itself (in mutt -v and in <show-version>) as:

	Mutt 1.5.21+26,mq+22 (7edc2073390d) (2010-09-15)

	I have applied 26 changesets applied since 1.5.21 was tagged, 22 of
	which are in my mq patch series. A 1.5.21 release build that is not
	mercurial-based would still appear simply as "1.5.21".

	* send.c: Allow setting message security in send2-hook

	This patch delays checking the message security options until after
	the user has an initial chance to edit the message. This allows the
	security options to be set in a send2-hook when using $edit_headers.
	Without this patch, the user has no way of automatically setting
	security based on recipients since the to/cc prompts are bypassed.

	The other change in behavior is if the user happened to use a
	send2-hook to see if the message had security applied *prior* to
	editing the message, that no longer works.

	change-folder.

	For example, start with -y and type a wrong IMAP password so that no
	mailbox is open. Trying to change folders resulted in a crash.

	* pattern.c: Clear last search pattern if it's invalid.
	Closes #3315.

	We keep both, the string version and compiled version around for
	search-next; however, in case of parsing errors we dropped only the
	compiled version and not the string one making the code attempting
	to perform a search using a NULL pattern.

	* pattern.c: Bail on missing pattern modifiers at end of pattern.
	Closes #3314.

	* buffy.c, muttlib.c, mx.c, mx.h, status.c: Unconditionally define

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: use full names for &eacute; and

	This is necessary because we want to install a us-ascii manual.txt

	2.60+ to work, though if given --with-docdir will silently override

	* init.c, mutt.h, muttlib.c: Move remove_from_rx_list() to muttlib.c,
	name it mutt_remove_from_rx_list()

2009-07-22 15:25 +0200  Fabian Groffen  <grobian@gentoo.org>  (d41e043fa775)

	* keymap.c: Use CRYPT_BACKEND_GPGME instead of non-existent
	HAVE_GPGME

2009-07-22 14:43 +0200  kees  <kees@outflux.net>  (848f08512bf3)

	* hcache.c, rfc822.h: Properly restore addresses from hcache using
	rfc822_new_address(). Closes #3302.

	* mh.c: Don't leak mhs flags in mh_buffy(). Closes #3303.

2009-07-17 17:57 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (a3c4b605cfad)

	* UPDATING: add batch mode send-hooks note to UPDATING

2009-07-14 20:25 -0700  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (084fb086a0e7)

	* send.c: Make send-hooks work for batch mode. Closes
	#3219.

	Handle SENDBATCH inline with the normal sending code, instead of
	handling it separately. This allows send-hooks to run, along with
	removing a number of unnecessarily lines of code.

2009-07-11 14:52 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6f942afe60b5)

	* charset.c, mbyte.c: Recognize charset extensions, see #3150.

	With utf-8//TRANSLIT, we internally didn't recognize it as utf-8.
	This leads to badly broken behaviour if --without-wc-funcs is used
	for some reason. In that case, if we have utf-8 as charset, we
	implement our own wide char functions; for all other charsets, we
	use the system single-byte locale functions. And using these with
	utf-8 is broken.

	* curs_lib.c: Render blanks to spaces in index, fixes
	[298194c414f0]

	wcwidth(<tab>) returns -1 so 'foo<tab>bar' was rendered to 'foobar',
	and now to 'foo bar'. Closes #3270 again.

2009-07-08 13:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f22b71d8005a)

	* curs_main.c: Handle keepalive failure when changing folders. There
	are probably many other places where this kind of thing could happen
	though. See #3028.

2009-07-01 18:13 -0700  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f6c6066a5925)

	* account.c, mutt_sasl.c, smtp.c: Make getuser/pass abort
	if input is required in batch mode. Replaces [0a3de4d9a009]. See
	#3289.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add detailed section on charset
	handling

	* smtp.c: SMTP: use $smtp_pass in batch mode. Closes #3289.

	mutt_account_getpass() copying the password from $smtp_pass into the
	account structure is only called from the SASL callback we only use
	if we're sure we don't need curses (i.e. have the pass already).

2009-06-30 17:32 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f4baa2f1251a)

	* pgpewrap.c: Add missing config.h include to pgpewrap.c

	It technically doesn't need it, but pgpewrap should be rebuilt after
	configure ran, too.

	* doc/Makefile.am: Manual: Run lynx with --display_charset
	=us-ascii, see #3286.

2009-06-29 18:20 +0000  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (03c65df651e0)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Move new mail detection into
	its own section

	This also updates some parts of docs and adds missing ones. It also
	adds a note about the recent changes, also to UPDATING.

2009-06-29 18:03 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (d3a7e0334e5d)

	* url.c, url.h: Revert URL path encoding for now

	It breaks gmail url display and makes bcache use different paths.
	Still we need to think about whether we want to allow any character
	in bcache paths (possibly multibyte, possibly depending on
	$charset).

2009-06-28 20:49 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (298194c414f0)

	* imap/command.c: Not being able to start an IMAP command
	is a fatal error. Closes #3155.

	* imap/auth_login.c: IMAP LOGIN does not support separate user and
	login accounts. Use the user account for both. Closes #3240.

2009-06-27 17:07 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7ca8d09f7d2c)

	* hg-commit: hg-commit: drop changelog entries from hg log

	* doc/makedoc.c, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: stop using DocBook
	entities mapping to ascii chars

	There's no real benefit, it only makes reading/writing the manual
	harder. All entities that potentially map to non-ascii characters
	(&mdash, &auml, etc.) are left so that manual.xml remains pure
	ascii.

2009-06-26 21:47 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (b2b97c7a2ae6)

	The fixes are: 1) allow / in usernames for IMAP (by %-encoding /, :

	* url.c: Don't parse URL port as signed short, but to int and cast to
	unsigned short. Closes #3264.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add a short note about new header
	folding

	...so we don't get bug reports for tab folding.

	* init.h: Clarify what $wrap=0 does

	* doc/mutt.css: CSS update for newer docbook xslt versions

	* pager.c: pager: intermediate fix for wrapping long header lines with
	$smart_wrap set

	The header folding algorithm outputs a word without spaces and
	longer than $wrap as-is. The pager however tries to break it. With
	$smart_wrap unset, it simply breaks at $wrap regardless if there's a
	space or not. With $smart_wrap set it tried to find a space and
	break if the next word is too long. This logic doesn't work for
	folded header lines which always start with space. Thus, the output
	would always contain the folding whitespace on a line by itself
	detaching the header value from the header name.

	As an intermediate fix we don't try to be smart if the line begins
	with space or tab.

	* pager.c, sendlib.c: pager: Ignore $wrap for attachment markers

2009-06-14 20:57 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (d2e0b495b148)

	* doc/dotlock.man, doc/makedoc.c, doc/mbox.man, doc/mmdf.man,
	doc/mutt.man, init.h: Fix hyphens in manpages. Closes #1937

2009-06-04 17:07 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4f1ceaae93dc)

	* rfc3676.c: Fix pretty quoting for f=f by resetting space count when
	flushing paragraph

2009-06-03 22:35 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (386f2ce6b872)

	* rfc3676.c: Fix several f=f bugs

	It fixes problems with space-handling in general (trailing spaces
	for display, un-space-stuffing), fixes quote prefix for replies and
	lowers FLOWED_MAX so we don't run into line length trouble too
	early.

	* UPDATING, globals.h, init.h, pager.c: Don't abuse $pager_context for
	searches, add $search_context. See #976.

	* pattern.c: Fix compiler warning

2009-06-02 20:25 +0200  Miroslav Lichvar  <mlichvar@redhat.com>  (d1d0481d1ca1)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Add support for GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM
	error code

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Don't ignore certificate verification errors on
	saved signer certs

2009-06-02 10:18 -0700  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (761bc678b23e)

	* po/nl.po: Updated Dutch translation.

2009-06-02 17:24 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (8b2af5b64981)

	* buffy.c: Fix duplicate mailbox detection for remote
	folders

	* smtp.c: Fix array size

	* buffy.c: Thoroughly check for duplicates when parsing
	'mailboxes' command. Closes #1428.

2009-06-01 14:50 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7a277ba306c9)

	* gnupgparse.c: Use mutt_atoi() when parsing GnuPG output. Closes
	#3145

	* hcache.c, mh.c: More atoi() fixes

	* smtp.c: SMTP: Use mutt_atoi() to parse server responses

	* curs_main.c, edit.c, init.c, main.c, menu.c, mh.c, parse.c,
	resize.c, score.c, url.c: Use strtol() wrappers for most atoi()
	calls

	* lib.c, lib.h: Add mutt_atos(), mutt_atoi() and
	mutt_atol() (strtol() wrappers)

	* send.c: Treat address groups as no recipients

	When sending with Sendmail or SMTP we exclude address groups anyway,
	so treat these addresses as not present when checking for valid
	recipients before sending in the compose menu.

	* smtp.c: Weed out address groups for SMTP the same way we
	do for sendmail

2009-05-31 19:19 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (0024860ab03e)

	* doc/Makefile.am: Allow chunked and unchunked manuals to build in
	parallel.

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Remove trailing whitespace

2009-05-31 14:46 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (8e591e80cd48)

	* smtp.c: SMTP: Don't send "undisclosed-recipients" in RCPT TO

	This happened for Bcc only messages. "undisclosed-recipients" is
	added in To: as guard against MTAs that leak BCCs if no To:/Cc:
	header is given. See Debian #529090.

	* init.h: Document that $pager_context affects searching, too

	* UPDATING: Update UPDATING

	* handler.c: Turn trailing \r\n to \n for qp-encoded messages.

	RFC2045 (sect. 6.7, (1) general 8bit representation) states that
	neither CR nor LF of the trailing CRLF may be qp-encoded. So we
	ignore trailing qp-encoded CRs.

	See #2898 though this is a partial fix only.

	* pager.c: Give $pager_context lines of context when searching
	page-based menus. Closes #976.

	* handler.c, init.h, rfc3676.c: f=f: Strip trailing spaces for
	interoperability. Closes #3001.

	If we make a fixed reply to a flowed message we remove trailing
	spaces and can now safely allow $indent_string to be used which is
	what users expect.

	Second, if we make a flowed reply to a fixed message we also strip
	trailing spaces since from format=fixed we assume all lines are
	fixed (i.e. we don't want to errorneously make fixed lines flowed).

	* handler.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add $honor_disposition to not display
	attachments inline. Closes #3170.

	Previously all MIME parts were displayed inline regardless of the
	Content-Disposition header (if present). With $honor_disposition
	set, only inline parts are displayed inline, attachments can only be
	viewed from the attachments menu.

2009-04-25 01:56 -0400  Dan Loewenherz  <daniel.loewenherz@yale.edu>  (c1b947f60ea6)

2009-05-30 19:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (b080ae086a62)

	* ChangeLog, mbox.c: Keep new mail flag for mbox/mmdf folders after
	closing. Closes #1362.

2009-05-30 10:23 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (be7b3d349725)

	* smtp.c: Fix logic in f260f5836284

2009-05-29 21:33 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c4d86d4ea260)

	* pager.c: Drop modified version of and use mutt_read_line() in pager,
	too

	* history.c, init.c, lib.c, lib.h, mh.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c, pgp.c,
	query.c, rfc1524.c, smime.c: Add flags to mutt_read_line() for
	EOL-stripping and continuation support

	We use these to stop supporting EOL-escaping with \ which was wrong
	in most cases (e.g. $history_file), support is kept for reading
	config and mailcap files.

	Leaving CRLF in will be used for the pager.

	* menu.c, pager.c, pattern.c: Fall back to search if no query exists
	for search-(next|opposite)

	The pager had the fall-through to search, so for consistency do that
	in other menues as well.

	* pager.c: Fix pager search prompt for reverse search

	When doing a reverse search for the first time after switching to
	the pager, SearchBack is always 0 and thus gave the wrong prompt,
	change to using op directly. While I'm at it, unify search prompts.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix markup of environment variables

2009-05-28 16:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f260f5836284)

	* smtp.c: SMTP: don't interactively authenticate without a
	password in batch/mailx mode

	Otherwise, if we don't have a password and curses is not running,
	the SASL authentication callback will crash mutt. We now abort if
	the password wasn't given in $smtp_url.

	* doc/mutt.css: Manual: vertical-align table cells at the top

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/mutt.css: Manual: Wrap muttrc commands
	in <command/>

2009-05-27 23:14 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (5502fb790bab)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: gnutls: do not ignore certificate problems.
	Specifically, do not allow revoked certificates or those signed by
	non-CAs unless they have been explicitly stored in the trusted
	certificate file. Thanks to Miroslav Lichvar.

2009-05-27 22:55 -0700  Miroslav Lichvar  <mlichvar@redhat.com>  (85f41efec6bf)

	* ChangeLog, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Don't prompt to save certificates that
	are already saved but invalid.

2009-05-27 22:52 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (90ef283c103e)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Don't leak gnutls certs on preauth validation
	failure. Thanks to Miroslav Lichvar.

	* mutt_ssl.c: Fix TLS certificate chain validation for
	openssl.

2009-05-25 17:31 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (8f11dd00c770)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Fix a serious oversight validating TLS
	certificates. If any certificate in a chain presented by a server
	was accepted, the connection was allowed without verifying that the
	presented certificate was actually signed by the certificate in the
	chain.

2009-05-27 22:13 -0700  Petr Písař  <petr.pisar@atlas.cz>  (05bc65d6ae70)

2009-05-13 14:20 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f96a176bb14c)

	* send.c: Don't set 'replied' flag if user changes
	References/IRT. Closes #2044.

	* mutt.h, muttlib.c: Add mutt_find_list() to lookup data in lists

	* alias.c, crypt-gpgme.c, group.c, mbox.c, pgp.c, query.c,
	rfc822.c, rfc822.h, send.c, smime.c: Prune empty address groups
	when preparing replies. Closes #2875.

	* mbox.c: Actually reopen mbox/mmdf files in case we find
	modifications. Closes #2725.

	Since the file is changed while we have it open in ctx->fp, we
	likely get wrong information when parsing the mailbox. Now we
	explicitely close and (re)open it.

2009-05-12 16:26 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (06e318bfe8f2)

	* mbox.c: Backout errorneously commited mbox atime fix

	* OPS, mbox.c: Fix description for <save-message>

2009-04-29 14:49 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (335e6f782862)

	* browser.c: Fix maildir times in mailboxes browser. Closes #626.

	Instead of using the (pointless) mtime of the top-level maildir
	folder, use the latest mtime of the "new" and "cur" subdirectories.
	Maildir folders in the mailboxes list can now be properly sorted by
	date. This does not affect the directory browser. Also see #2421.

	* mailbox.h, mh.c, mx.c: Move Maildir/MH folder detection from
	mx.c to mh.c

2009-04-28 15:12 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4d9685be5987)

2009-04-28 13:05 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a13d8fd40094)

	* send.c: Don't generate References: for reply to multiple
	messages

	All parent Message-Ids are present in In-Reply-To already. Also,
	RfC2822, section 3.6.4 discourages its generation.

	* sendlib.c: Don't trim In-Reply-To with $edit_headers set

	In case of a tagged reply to several messages, we want In-Reply-To
	to contain all parent Message-Ids.

	* imap/imap.c: Only sync changed messages back to hcache on
	mailbox sync

	* doc/manual.xml.head: For spam detection, mention $imap_headers.

2009-04-26 21:09 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (9fa4a3e74355)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head, pop.c: POP: Support hcache updating,
	too.

	This also allows us to use hcache to manage "flagged" and "replied"
	message flags.

	* imap/imap.c, mh.c: Sync header to hcache when synching
	MH/Maildir/IMAP folders. Closes #2942.

	* pager.c: Use dynamic buffer for displaying pager lines. Closes
	#3162.

	With too small fixed-size buffers we can't color/find certain words
	that span buffers. This needs to duplicate mutt_read_line with the
	adjustment to leave line termination in and not support breaking
	long lines using \ at EOL. Other callers may want to use this one
	instead, too as we support \-escaping in too many places.

	* init.h: Document suffixes for %f in $folder_format

2009-04-22 23:29 +0200  Bertram Felgenhauer  <int-e@gmx.de>  (0aa313a3bf20)

2009-04-21 15:10 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (3d89eddb2d9a)

	* buffy.c: Equivalent mutt_buffy, but readable code

	* buffy.c, buffy.h: Call mutt_expand_path() from mutt_buffy to fix
	imap separator. Closes #3208 and #3218

	* buffy.c: Use slen instead of assuming _POSIX_PATH_MAX

	* pgp.c: Support the Charset: armor header for inline PGP. Closes
	#3039.

	The header is defined as optional by RfC4880.

	This is based on patch-1.5.9.tamo.pgp_charsetchack.1. We only
	support reading this header and, if present, recode the PGP output
	from the given charset to $charset if we find it valid; otherwise
	fall back to UTF-8. Certain clients make use of the header when
	sending mail, so mutt should respect it because some messages are
	otherwise unreadable.

	The sending side is not touched, we unconditionally send UTF-8.

	* init.h, sendlib.c: Backed out changeset 23c7b469ff20

	This requires more thought: if the user has -- in $sendmail, we need

	See #3168.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Make sure every rc command has a

	* doc/gen-map-doc, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix openjade
	warnings

	* doc/makedoc.c, doc/mutt.css: makedoc: Render description lists as
	<informaltable/>

	This looks better and is more compact (except missing column
	headers.)

2009-03-31 16:03 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (22f21b558f57)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add an example of how to manage
	multiple accounts using folder-hook

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head, mutt.h, pattern.c: Perform case
	insensitive string search if pattern is lower case

	...since we do that for regex patterns already. It doesn't work for
	IMAP server-side searches.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix markup of ".muttrc"

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Always spell mutt as "Mutt"

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Replace netscape with firefox

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: use <quote/> instead of " quotes

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Lots of minor improvements
	(markup consistency, wording)

2009-03-30 14:58 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (318748f3962b)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: For mailbox formats, add some more verbose pros
	and cons

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add section about zeroprinting format
	strings to format string section

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add section roughly explaining config
	option types

	* doc/makedoc.c: makedoc: make output slightly more readable

	Add <?dhtml... processing instructions to render <variablelist/>
	using HTML <table/> which save lots of vertical space. Also, drop
	the newline before </screen> to save some space.

2009-03-27 18:02 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a06a2a4c5ebc)

2009-03-19 17:19 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (754ea0f091fc)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Improve section on patterns

	* curs_lib.c: Fix progress update debug message

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head: Document kilo and mega
	suffixes for range patterns

	Document it only for ~z (message size) as they don't make much sense
	for other patterns like message score or number of attachments.

2009-03-18 17:40 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (8528b8e715da)

	structs

2009-03-17 16:44 +0100  Todd Zullinger  <tmz@pobox.com>  (bb9b845800f6)

	* pgp.c: Ensure display is redrawn for application/pgp

	When using gpg-agent, a hard redraw is needed after the pinentry
	program is called. Otherwise, the screen is garbled and key
	bindings are screwed up.

	Closes #3196.

2009-03-15 16:44 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (bc7c64ff3e48)

	* configure.ac, protos.h, wcscasecmp.c: Add wcscasecmp() compatibility
	function (for OS X)

	* doc/mutt.man: mutt.1: Mention that -a should be last in option
	list. Closes #3202

	* alias.c: Only define min() if not present. Closes #3199

2009-03-15 14:25 +0100  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (3c154fcdad4c)

	* rfc822.c: The assigned value of dom is never used. Remove
	assignment

	* alias.c: The file handle will leak if fread fails

2009-03-12 15:16 -0700  Erik Hovland  <erik@hovland.org>  (53bea026a2a2)

	* curs_main.c: resort_index will use menu->current as a index into an
	array. If menu->current is negative, bad things can happen. So check
	it before calling resort_index

	* recvcmd.c: 'last' is assigned but never used. Remove assignment.

2009-03-15 13:46 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (1238dff54a15)

	* mh.c: Fix crashes with 64bit time_t. Closes #3184.

2009-03-09 12:04 +0100  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (4ce562b7f5d7)

	* mbyte.h: Unbreak compilation on OS X with --with-regex/--without-wc-
	funcs. Closes #3149.

2009-03-09 11:58 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (f3a33b77dc90)

	* mutt.h, regex.c: Unbreak compilation with --without-wc- funcs on
	OS X 10.5.*, see #3149.

	* init.h: Fix 11cd72da743a

	* init.h: Sort SSL-related variables, see #3191.

	* hash.c, hash.h, init.c, mh.c, thread.c: Restore $reverse_alias
	feature by using case-insensitive hash keys

	The fix is implemented as callbacks in the hash table so we can
	avoid working with copies of the mailbox keys but work on the
	originals instead and don't pollute the code with lower-case
	conversions all over the place.

	While I'm at it, turn int hashes into unsigned values since the hash
	function returns unsigned values now, too.

	Closes #3185.

2009-03-07 13:49 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ff1906f70b1b)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: verbosely document how the
	initial folder is determined, see #3189.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Document address normalization. Closes #2430.

	* headers.c: Simplify and fix Attach: header parsing

	With ee5e696a9d08 we would skip beyond the filename to look for a
	description. This changeset fixes it.

	* main.c: Set magic from -m before processing queries (-Q) or dumping
	variables (-D)

	* doc/mutt.man, init.h: Better document how the initial folder is
	determined. Closes #3189.

2009-02-15 16:09 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ee5e696a9d08)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, headers.c: Support spaces in Attach:
	pseudoheader. Closes #3179.

	* imap/imap.c: Move socket close into imap_logout from imap_logout_all

	* imap/imap.c: IMAP: only close socket when not already
	disconnected.

	* help.c: Fix help alignment for escape sequences at screen
	boundary. Closes #3146.

	#3166.

2009-01-26 12:32 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (da94a92c3ba0)

2009-01-13 06:51 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (10e224e86f0b)

	* hook.c: Do not allow a command in an account-hook to trigger another
	account-hook. Recent changes in the IMAP path canonifier mean that
	account-hooks that set variables to URLs (eg folder, spoolfile) can
	trigger a recursive account-hook. Now we just bail out of account-
	hook early if we are called recursively, but perhaps we should warn
	the user to use a folder-hook instead. Thanks to Kyle Wheeler for
	finding this one.

2009-01-12 10:27 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (6976aca75d04)

2009-01-10 22:09 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (db3a61fcde35)

	* imap/util.c: Assume INBOX for ""/NULL in imap_mxcmp

	* imap/util.c: Use known connection delimiter in imap_expand_path

	* imap/util.c: Guard against NULL pointers in imap_mxcmp

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c: Canonicalize IMAP mailboxes before
	comparing them.

	* imap/util.c: Fix last commit

	* imap/util.c: Prioritize the entered IMAP folder delimiter. First
	priority is the connection delimiter. Second priority is the user's
	delimiter if it is in imap_delim_chars. We no longer use the first
	character in imap_delim_chars.

	in #3041. See #2902, #2935, #2985, #3028, #3041, #3143. With luck,
	this may close them. In truth, imap_read_headers is still a horrible
	kludge of duct tape and chicken wire.

	* hash.c, hash.h: Make hash_string work in unsigned domain

	* main.c: Another copyright update

	* main.c, smtp.c: Update some copyrights

2009-01-02 23:13 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (87ef3e3550e4)

2009-01-02 12:46 -0800  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (5db868a874b6)

	* globals.h, mutt_ssl.c: Add support for intermediate certificates to

2009-01-01 17:02 -0800  Marcel Telka  <marcel@telka.sk>  (532f695b4352)

	recvcmd.c, send.c: Remove unused #include directives

	* sendlib.c: mutt_gen_msgid() allocates the msgid off of the heap.

	Since mutt_gen_msgid() allocates the msgid string with strdup, it is
	getting it off of the heap.

	When the fprintf writes the msgid, the string is no longer tracked

	Elements such as lists, tables, synopsis don't need it and produce

	Manage last search pattern outside of menu lifecycle

	Previously, the pattern was thrown away during menu destruction. For
	the next search, mutt then can't provide a good suggestion. The new

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Fix typo

	* mbyte.c: Provide legacy implementations for iswalpha() and
	iswupper()

	In mbyte.h and without using wc functions, only the prototypes were

	These new functions are derived from the iswalnum() and towupper()

	* curs_lib.c, enter.c, flags.c, keymap.c, menu.c: Rework timeout
	handling to support keepalive in the line editor. Also allow
	keepalives of less than $timeout without returning before $timeout,
	so people who don't want to be notified of new mail don't have to
	be.

2008-08-29 23:10 -0700  Rado Smiljanic  <regrado@web.de>  (4f67fc336986)

	* curs_main.c, keymap.c, menu.c, pager.c: Make curses timeout the

	instead of directly in menu. Closes #2747.

2008-08-29 22:40 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (e37ae3f79ec0)

	* imap/imap_private.h: Dead code

	* imap/imap.c: Remove redundant code

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Use sorted headers in imap_exec_msgset. Fixes [e68f79fef249]. Closes

2008-08-29 10:23 +0200  YONETANI Tomokazu  <qhwt+mutt@les.ath.cx>  (78aab353e217)

	* buffy.c: Only consider empty files non-existent for buffy's
	purpose.

	According to SUS, the st_size member of struct stat is undefined for
	directories. In case a system reports 0, the newly_created flag will
	be set for a directory and the magic will be cleared.

	If the folder type is cleared, mutt won't check the folder for new
	mail and thus will ignore MH and Maildir type folders on such a fs
	completely (e.g. the HAMMER fs on DragonFly BSD).

2008-08-28 11:19 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (1d94905ad00b)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	The msgset changes seem buggy. Reverting pending further testing.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Split long IMAP commands for the benefit of lazy servers (closes
	#3000). Also touches lots of old, hairy code. Likely to wake
	sleeping dogs.

2008-08-26 23:09 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (2731e5174c5a)

	* imap/util.c, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c:
	Properly set the SASL external auth name when using SSL client
	certs. Also zero out the account structure before filling it with
	available data. Client certificates + SASL EXTERNAL were only
	working by luck.

	* imap/imap.c: Remove leftover IMAP IDLE handling from before
	[53d9210aa4ee].

2008-08-25 00:52 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (36aa1130091a)

	* UPDATING, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, init.c, init.h: Introduce
	$imap_pipeline_depth. This lets users control the number of
	commands that mutt will queue up before sending them to the
	server. Setting this to 0 disables pipelining, which should close
	#2892.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c:
	Rework IMAP command queueing to allow pipelining to be disabled.
	IDLE handling has been better abstracted, and there are fewer entry
	points to the IMAP command issuing machinery. Any commands that are
	simply queued may be executed whenever the pipeline fills, instead
	of requiring explicit handling in the caller.

	Tested on my Cyrus server, but I wouldn't be surprise if this causes
	new problems.

	* main.c: Whitespace cleanup

	* main.c: Handle -- correctly with or without -a, closes #3097

	Prefix optstring with "+" to force POSIX behavior on GNU getopt, and
	thereby prevent reordering argv. This allows us to correctly handle

	end-of-options.

	* init.h: Better documentation for how quote_regexp determines
	quote level. Closes #1463.

2008-08-19 09:39 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (3e850c6e43fd)

	* handler.c, mutt.h: Make text/enriched handler multibyte aware.
	Closes #3033.

2008-08-18 13:08 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (95a11c7f677d)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2008-08-18 10:24 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (51bd7a47d552)

	* pager.c: Ignore zero width characters U+200B/U+FEFF which may garble
	the display. Closes #3061, #3048.

	* charset.c, charset.h, init.c: Validate charset names for all
	charset options. Validation is either done against mutt's table of
	IANA assigned names or local iconv implementation (based on the
	assumption that iconv_open(charset,charset) fails if charset is
	unknown to the implementation). Closes #1668.

2008-08-15 11:53 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (ff3fbb6a92a8)

	* mutt_sasl.c: Fix type-punning warning in sasl_getprop usage

	* parse.c: Fix a couple of compiler warnings introduced in
	[00ce81d778bf]. Make the style of mutt_parse_references more
	pleasing to me.

2008-07-10 09:38 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (d3ee9644765f)

	* copy.c: Fix three bugs handling flags in mutt_copy_header

	1. mutt_copy_header incorrectly tests CH_UPDATE to determine whether
	to write the In-Reply-To and References headers. CH_UPDATE
	refers only to Status: and X-Status:

	2. mutt_copy_header ignores CH_NOSTATUS which is supposed to
	indicate that the mailbox type doesn't use those headers.

	3. mutt_copy_header tests h->env->irt_changed and
	h->env->refs_changed when it should be testing CH_UPDATE_IRT and
	CH_UPDATE_REFS, respectively. Early in the function this
	happens:

	 if (h->env) flags |= (h->env->irt_changed ? CH_UPDATE_IRT
	: 0) | (h->env->refs_changed ? CH_UPDATE_REFS : 0);

	 This means that for most callers, the result is the same, but
	mutt_copy_header should be testing the flags because the caller
	might have set them explicitly without setting
	irt_changed/refs_changed.

	* parse.c, protos.h, send.c: Unify parser for message-ids

	Rewrite mutt_extract_message_id and change mutt_parse_references to
	us it. The parser in mutt_extract_message_id is looser than the old
	one in mutt_parse_references; it just looks for <[^\s>]+> and
	doesn't worry about @-signs. Additionally it doesn't use strtok, so
	the input string can be const.

	Closes #3090, #1935, #1116 (both the stated bug and the conversation
	following).

2008-08-11 16:42 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (508ffc26dad2)

	* alias.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.c: Prefer "backtick" over
	"backtic" on comments and docs as it's more common, closes #3101.

2008-07-27 10:48 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (3f595d14a285)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: doc: semi-colon needs quoting too

	If semi-colon is bound or macro'd, it needs to be quoted like space,
	otherwise mutt thinks it's separating commands.

2008-07-21 10:24 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (96b0dd25a550)

	* copy.h, mutt.h: noop cleanup: move mutt_copy_header flags to copy.h

	Noticed while reading that these flags are better defined in copy.h
	than mutt.h. Builds without warnings.

	* m4/codeset.m4, m4/iconv.m4: Fix m4 serial numbers to avoid
	aclocal 1.10 warnings

2008-07-21 11:42 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7e6d98886cce)

	* doc/makedoc.c: makedoc: Add ".ie" and ".il" to support itemized
	lists.

	Some settings docs use verbatim screen environments to print lists
	while support for real lists will make it look nicer: for docbook
	use <itemizedlist/>, \(hy for roff and '-' for text.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Document that account-hook is intended for
	connection-related settings only

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Use tables for message flags as it's
	more compact

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: minor formatting tweaks

	* alias.c, init.h: Encode lines written to $alias_file in
	$config_charset if set. Closes #3095

2008-07-10 09:38 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (7729b1ad530c)

	* copy.c, protos.h, sendlib.c: Unify mutt_write_references

	copy.c and sendlib.c have independent and different implementations
	of writing references to a file. Choose the one in sendlib since
	it's conservative with mallocs and supports trimming the list.

	Signed-off-by: Aron Griffis <agriffis@n01se.net>

	* copy.c: Clean up error handling in mutt_copy_header

	mutt_copy_header unnecessarily tests the result of each fputc/fputs
	(well, most of them anyway, it's not consistent). This obfuscates
	the code and hides bugs. Remove these extraneous checks since
	ferror/feof are checked at the bottom of the function, and get rid
	of all the early returns.

	remove

2008-07-11 11:34 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (cc67b008038c)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Mention that @ can be used in usernames in URLs

	* charset.c: Allow UTF-8 charset to be misspelled as "utf8"

	* mutt_ssl.c: Verify hostname in (Open)SSL certificate validation

	This is based on the patch by gkloepfer attached to #3087 but passes
	the proper connection as argument (avoiding adding hostname to
	struct sslsockdata) and validates the hostname even in case OpenSSL
	cannot find the local issuer certificate. GnuTLS already supports
	hostname checking. Closes #3087.

2008-07-10 22:02 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (b9ac445b035b)

	* hcache.c: Prevent some pointers of 'struct body' being saved to
	hcache

	This addresses the hcache safety issue but maybe doesn't fix it
	completely, see #2942. This also prevents mutt from crashing when
	using a hcache that was synced when syncing the mailbox (updating
	changed and fully-parsed messages).

2008-07-10 21:46 +0200  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (6244eefaea64)

	* headers.c: Remove completely wrong comment regarding in-reply-to and

2008-07-02 18:23 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7783502a04c7)

	* curs_main.c: Calculate menu->max after a possible resort in index
	(maybe changing number of messages). Closes #3088.

	* curs_lib.c: Fix casts for progress update to prevent -ftrapv
	aborts to trigger. Closes #3018.

2008-07-02 08:56 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (c51c16db46cc)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Only make LC_MESSAGES conditional on NLS in GPGME
	locale support.

	realpath() in mutt_pretty_mailbox() for paths that may need
	it. This requires to add the buffer size as parameter since the
	result may be longer than the original but still fit in the
	buffer. Closes #2948.

2008-07-01 20:06 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (fb0df4ae0836)

2008-07-01 18:29 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f9af0501d2dd)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Set GPGME locale on first attempt to create context.
	Closes #2913.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, crypt-gpgme.h, crypt-mod-pgp-gpgme.c: Stub in a
	gpgme version of extract-keys. It doesn't currently work right
	because apparently while gpg on the command line can parse a whole
	message, we'll have to do it for gpgme. I really wonder about the
	'ME' part of GPGME sometimes.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, lib.c, lib.h: Support displaying application/pgp-keys
	with GPGME. This was pretty convoluted because GPGME provides no way
	to examine a key block without importing it. This code creates a
	temporary GPG home in which to import the key in order to display
	it.

	* crypt-gpgme.c, handler.c, pgp.c: Handle DONTHANDLEPGPKEYS in
	handler instead of crypto modules. This lets gpgme and classic pgp
	share a bit of logic, and unbreaks key extraction at least for
	classic PGP.

	* copy.c: Bail out of copy if decryption is requested but the desired
	engine is missing. This closes #2684, but handling of mixed crypto
	in a single message needs more investigation.

2008-07-01 01:10 -0700  rtc  <rtc@gmx.de>  (49fe0292b503)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Improve gpgme SMIME uid display: align each line by
	the length of the first.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Show more information about problematic SMIME
	signatures under gpgme. Also warn if the key is not known to be
	good. For some reason expired keys in my environment are not
	flagged as expired in sig->status or sig->summary.

2008-06-28 20:33 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (1492c24f2a4e)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Extract CN from client certificate in gnutls.
	Nothing currently uses it, but I suspect we should be using it as
	the external auth name in mutt_sasl_client_new.

	* UPDATING, globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c:
	Basic support for $ssl_client_cert when compiled with
	gnutls. The key must not be encrypted. Closes #2911.

2008-06-25 23:40 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (32374c911c6c)

	* smime.c: Check S/MIME signing ID exists before attempting to use
	it. Closes #3069. Also make (s)ign automatically ask for a key if
	no default is defined.

	* init.h: Make $move default to no instead of ask-no. Closes #2945.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Document difference between index and pager
	search. Closes #2886.

	* commands.c, copy.c, crypt-gpgme.c, handler.c, mbox.c, pgp.c: Make
	mutt_copy_message distinguish between fatal and non-fatal errors.
	Non-fatal errors should prevent moving messages, since they indicate
	data loss. But mutt should still attempt to display them, since
	being able to see some attachments is better than nothing. Also stop
	printing out non-PGP material in application/pgp attachments. Closes
	#2545, #2912.

2008-06-24 23:12 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f5fe657f0633)

	* handler.c: Make multipart decoding a little more
	forgiving. First, ignore bad content-transfer-encoding in
	multipart sections. Second, if an attachment fails to decode,
	print a warning and continue instead of giving up on the entire
	message.

2008-05-23 01:40 -0400  Todd Zullinger  <tmz@pobox.com>  (73a180edce53)

	* pgp.c: Call mutt_need_hard_redraw() in pgp_decrypt_part().

	This change ensures that the screen is redrawn when using gpg-agent.
	Without this, mutt's navigation keybindings are lost after pinentry
	curses prompts for a passphrase to descrypt a message.

2008-05-28 22:16 -0700  Moritz Schulte  <moritz@g10code.com>  (7fd74c40eced)

2008-01-15 17:34 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (b3cde588fe9a)

	* recvattach.c: Prepend './' to (some) suggested filenames when saving
	attachments. Attachment filenames may start with characters that are
	special to mutt_expand_path() may cause undesired expansion. Closes
	#1719.

	* INSTALL, README: Update stale INSTALL+README files

2008-01-14 22:54 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (dae38f5ab2a5)

	* ChangeLog, mh.c: hcache: Fetch data for correct message from hcache.
	With $maildir_header_cache_verify set (the default), the list (and
	thus the current) header change after data was fetched from hcache
	making some message appear as duplicate. Now fetch data for the
	correct message after possible in-place inode sorting altering file
	order. See debian bug #459739.

	* hcachever.sh.in: hcache: use HEADER for version calculation too

2008-01-09 13:06 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (2a5636080210)

	* configure.ac: Fix mutt_dotlock build issue on cygwin
	(closes #3009).

	* init.h: Mention $recall in description for $postpone

2008-01-02 11:47 -0800  Johan Svedberg  <johan@svedberg.com>  (3cf8bc21bc3d)

	* po/sv.po: Updated Swedish translation

2007-12-11 15:22 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (68a9c3e74f9a)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Update caching docs (hcache naming,
	maintenance)

	* pop.c: POP: Name hcache the way IMAP does. Place the file
	under $header_cache/<url>/mutt.hcache. For now ignore that this may
	break if hcache == bcache and a message's uid is "mutt.hcache"
	(extremely unlikely) in which case the user will loose only the
	hcache file.

	* pop.c: POP: Respect $message_cache_clean

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: mention $time_inc in tuning chapter

	* enter.c, history.h: Maintain different history lists for
	files and mailboxes. Closes #2999.

	* history.c: Do not trust history file and mutt code about history
	class. This prevents crashes as result of programming errors and/or
	wrong history file (e.g. negative or too high classes).

2007-12-08 12:54 -0800  Michael Elkins  <me@mutt.org>  (3971bcfd9112)

	* mh.c: Skip over messages which were previously parsed after sorting
	the tail of the list. Avoids a segmentation fault when rescanning
	the new/ subdir of a maildir when messages were left over from a
	previous scan.

2007-12-07 11:38 -0800  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (b891b1736885)

	* lib.c, md5.h: Check definition of ENOTSUP before use
	(closes #2983)

	* mh.c: Sort MH folders into natural order after 2nd pass (closes
	#463).

	* init.h: Mention subscribe and lists commands for
	$ignore_list_reply_to (closes #2996).

	* mx.c: Don't attempt to move messages when $mbox is unset.

2007-12-05 10:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (63c97881cb76)

	* UPDATING, configure.ac, main.c, mh.c: Improve inode sorting,
	enable it by default and add MH support. Sorting is done on-demand
	only before the first stat() or open()
	($maildir_header_cache_verify=yes/hcache miss). Furthermore, only
	a partial list of messages starting from that item is sorted
	reducing sorting overhead in most cases. For a fully hcache'd
	folder with $maildir_header_cache_verify=no, no sorting is needed
	and no sorting will be done. MH parsing is now two-pass, too to
	simplify the code and remove duplication.

2007-11-30 10:29 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5c635c9b5982)

	* configure.ac: Add version numbers for bdb 4.6

	* parse.c, sendlib.c: RfC2047 decode/encode X-Label: header
	(Closes #2970).

	* commands.c: Format status line for external and internal pager the
	same way to make %P work

2007-11-29 16:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4899bcc1c2c3)

	* doc/db-cleanup.xsl: Add ascii-replacements for 0x2dc
	(tilde) and 0x2026 (...) too. The manual cannot be clean us-acii
	but now we should have at least latin1

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/db-cleanup.xsl: Add a really ugly hack to make
	sure the plain text manual is us-ascii. The hack is filtering
	manual.html to another HTML file but replacing unicode chars by
	their ascii equivalents. The intermediate file is used to dump HTML
	to us-ascii text (and only for that).

	* hcache.c: Fix hcache build issue when building with gdbm if qdbm
	is installed, too

2007-11-21 13:19 +0100  Miroslav Lichvar  <mlichvar@redhat.com>  (9286a76e79a2)

	* send.c: Don't ignore $from in batch send mode.

2007-11-23 15:11 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (12a1d843c975)

	* curs_lib.c: Don't attempt to print progress if inc is 0, just
	print initial message

2007-11-21 14:14 -0800  Ronny Haryanto  <ronnylist@haryan.to>  (0e99eaaecd67)

	* po/id.po: Updated Indonesian translation

2007-11-21 16:47 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (309ab3a63d91)

	* UPDATING: Add UPDATING entry for $check_mbox_size

	* init.h: Clarify the description for $timeout

	* UPDATING: Remove raw utf-8 char in UPDATING to make it ascii
	again

2007-11-20 19:46 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (96f931ae0b22)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document that save-hook/fcc-hook/fcc-
	save-hook use $index_format expandos. Closes #2135.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, pattern.c: Simple search: Allow
	[~+%] to be \-escaped. Closes #2426.

	* configure.ac, strsep.c: Add glibc implementation of strsep() in case
	a system misses it. Closes #2989.

	* lib.h, mbyte.c: Alternate fix for not calling
	bind_textdomain_codeset() to fix Solaris build.

2007-11-19 15:32 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (033eba2d6834)

	* rfc3676.c: Make f=f handler multibyte-aware by not buffering flowed
	content until it's finished. We now write out content as we read it
	(which simplifies the code quite a bit) and properly flow multibyte
	paragraphs. This should improve DelSp=yes handling where a flowed
	paragraph may not have spaces at all except trailing ones for
	flowable paragraphs (after concatenating lines we didn't have access
	to the original break points any longer). We still split content by
	ASCII space (this should be safe as f=f itself uses ASCII space to
	mark flowable lines (even for languages that aren't expected to use
	spaces, see DelSp). Closes #862.

2007-11-15 13:17 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (a0161768f631)

	* doc/makedoc-defs.h, doc/makedoc.c: Fix more documentation build
	issues. Define USE_SASL (for $smtp_authenticators) in makedoc-
	defs.h, include it in makedoc.c to force doc rebuild if makedoc-
	defs.h changes.

	* parse.c, protos.h, send.c: Properly parse and validate Message-IDs
	from my_hdrs. Closes #2452.

	* configure.ac: Check for bind_textdomain_codeset() outside libc,
	too.

2007-11-15 11:53 +0100  peb  <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>  (22c68faeec08)

	* lib.h: Don't use bind_textdomain_codeset() if we're not using
	NLS/gettext. Closes #2162.

2007-11-15 11:22 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (933e57dff004)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Properly document simple searches and its
	"secret" keywords. Closes #2136.

2007-11-13 13:31 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (7a4a154eefa5)

	* wcwidth.c: Fix compiler warnings in new wcwidth.c (too large values
	for 'unsigned short')

	* hg-commit: hg-commit: Run 'make validate' in doc/ if manual.xml
	is present

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document that %f in $index_format is
	either Return-Path: or From: depending on which parses correctly.
	Also note that alternates' regex should be as precise as possible to
	avoid mismatches. Closes #1894.

	* init.h: Properly document $hostname, link it to $use_domain and
	$hidden_host. Closes #891.

2007-11-07 14:54 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (84284776659e)

	* Makefile.am, po/Makefile.in.in, po/POTFILES.in: Don't build
	keymap_alldefs.h in srcdir as it may be read-only

	* po/Makefile.in.in: Don't try to build $(PACKAGE).pot in srcdir as it
	may be read-only

2007-11-08 22:13 -0800  Michael Elkins  <me@mutt.org>  (4bba47e6d026)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Removed the [!] prefix from the usage from the
	usage string for the un/mailboxes command since it has no special
	meaning in this context other than referring to $spoolfile.

2007-11-08 11:48 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (daf29fe0ed4c)

	* UPDATING, curs_lib.c, globals.h, init.h: Add $time_inc to
	control progress update frequency. I found 250ms to be noticeably
	different from the old behaviour, and it ruins the rounding of the
	other _inc variables.

	* color.c, copy.c, imap/command.c: Turn down some debug logging
	levels

2007-11-08 09:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (92a6bfbed657)

	* doc/Makefile.am: Add stamp-doc-rc to makedoc-all to build Muttrc
	with fresh checkout

2007-11-07 14:48 -0800  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (b68ccc2e66e2)

	* curs_lib.c, mutt_curses.h: Suppress progress bar updates less than
	250ms apart. Closes #2899.

2007-11-07 12:12 -0800  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (c62c5495d67c)

	* wcwidth.c: Updated wcwidth to Unicode 5.0

2007-11-07 12:03 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (fce40f3a1aec)

	* Makefile.am, Muttrc.head, doc/Makefile.am, doc/Muttrc.head, doc
	/makedoc-defs.h, doc/makedoc.c, functions.h, init.h, makedoc-defs.h,
	makedoc.c: Try to fix parallel build problems by moving makedoc to
	doc/. This also requires to move Muttrc into doc/.

2007-11-06 16:34 -0800  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (ac14b76ef8b2)

	* Makefile.am: Remove unnecessary workaround for automake
	dist target

2007-11-06 18:23 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (1770ab532bfd)

	* curs_lib.c, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, mbox.c, mh.c,
	mutt_curses.h, pattern.c, pop.c, pop_lib.c, smtp.c: Add
	percentages to progress bar optionally supplied by caller. This is
	necessary to let the mbox driver print useful percentages. If
	there's no percentage given and we have a size, calculate on it on
	our own.  Closes #2929.

	* mh.c: (Re-)Add total msg count to progress for parsing maildirs

2007-11-05 14:24 -0800  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (ecb694b6176b)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation

2007-11-05 17:47 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6b9e91edba54)

	* curs_lib.c: Save value of errno across mutt_endwin()
	calls. Mutt_endwin() is sometimes called after noticing an error
	but before printing the message via perror(). Closes #2965.

2007-11-05 15:53 +0100  Emanuele Giaquinta  <e.giaquinta@glauco.it>  (b8dc6926ddf4)

	* configure.ac, intl/Makefile.in, po/Makefile.in.in: Optionally define
	$datarootdir on our own for autoconf <2.60 compatibility. While I'm
	at it, fix two warnings in other files about ignoring datarootdir
	with autoconf >2.60. Closes #2905.

2007-11-04 18:27 +0100  cypher  <cypher@conuropsis.org>  (ab676b9f0c04)

	* url.c: Use strtok_r() to parse mailto: links, not strtok(). In
	case a headers needs to call mutt_parse_references() which uses
	strtok(), too, later headers will be silently discarded.  Closes
	#2968.

2007-11-04 18:14 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (6248b3c04f61)

	* main.c, url.c: Prevent mailto parsing buffer overflow by ignoring
	too long header. If they're longer than our buffer, we can't turn it
	into a header to be parsed by mutt_parse_rfc822_line() anyway, so we
	bail out in this case. Also make main() catchup mailto parsing
	errors. Closes #2980.

	* UPDATING: Add 1.5.17 to UPDATING

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Improve DSN docs (require sendmail-
	compatible MTA, add SMTP notes). Closes #2979

2007-11-03 11:12 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (0c054faeb285)

2007-11-01 21:21 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4f3814a57eaf)

	* INSTALL, UPDATING, rfc822.c: Unbreak exact address feature. The
	problem was that when reading back tempfiles for pager display,
	trailing \n were not removed from the input so the pager displayed 2
	instead of 1.

2007-11-01 12:13 -0700  Oswald Buddenhagen  <ossi@kde.org>  (8aebd2ea4db8)

	* configure.ac: Detect BDB automatically if --with-bdb is empty

2007-11-01 14:33 +0100  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (80f1331abec2)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: devel-notes.txt: Mention where hg repo is, how
	to clone and update

	* doc/TODO: Documentation: Add doc/TODO with some items still open

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: s/SMTP support/SMTP Support/ (for
	consitency)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Remove 404 link for fetchmail,
	mention getmail, too

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add short section on SSL/TLS support
	(needs more details)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Document URL syntax in just one place,
	let others refer to it.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Document optional SMTP support

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add some general notes about optional
	features. Mention 'configure --help' and 'mutt -v' output.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Move POP3, IMAP and
	cache-related sections to their own chapter.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: Add ids to all tables and use <xref/>
	for reference.

2007-10-31 16:34 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (7cebeacc3b83)

	* config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, install-sh, missing: Remove
	autotools support files which autoreconf -i can generate

	* Makefile.am, cvslog2changelog.pl: cvslog2changelog.pl is obsolete

	* doc/muttbug.man: s/Mercurial/hg/

	* doc/muttbug.man: s/cvs/Mercurial/

2007-10-31 14:09 -0700  rea-mutt  <rea-mutt@codelabs.ru>  (c6ce36a67121)

	* lib.c: Fall back to rename for ENOTSUP and EOPNOTSUPP
	too. Closes #2975

2007-10-31 14:04 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (51595292e112)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix the test for flushing queued STATUS requests in
	imap_buffy_check. This should fix the bug that caused every other
	IMAP connection to fail to get the new message counts. Thanks to exg
	for his generous help debugging this one.

2007-10-25 17:03 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5d96f24efa85)

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: Large file support for mutt_pretty_size().
	Based on a patch by Corinna Vinschen, adjusted for LOFF_T/OFF_T_FMT
	(closes #2191).

	* UPDATING: Add UPDATING entry for %P for $pager_format

2007-10-18 10:20 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (4e738d998bb3)

	* hdrline.c: Enlarge temporary buffer in hdr_format_str to prevent
	subject truncation. The subject along with the thread tree are
	composed using a SHORT_STRING-sized buffer which may lead to
	truncation even though the destination buffer is large enough.

2007-10-16 11:33 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c33f288c3aab)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: fix typo (closes #2971).

2007-10-15 11:01 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (35e5c34b7e91)

	* rfc3676.c: f=f: Print standalone fixed lines as-is (closes #2917).

2007-10-11 12:10 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c15eeb44f139)

	* UPDATING, doc/manual.xml.head: Document format string
	pipes. This is roughly the commit message only. Add a line to
	UPDATING (mark it as a change rather than a new feature as it may
	break setups).

	* init.h: Document that $indent_string actually is a format string.

	* muttlib.c: Do not consider empty pipes for filtering in format
	strings. This fixes a crash with $indent_string="|" and
	$text_flowed unset.

2007-09-28 11:06 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (709db707bcdf)

	* curs_lib.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Make mutt_FormatString()'s string
	truncation multibyte aware

2007-09-19 12:22 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (c768a1ebf78a)

	* menu.c: Enlarge buffers for printing menu entries from STRING to
	LONG_STRING. Now that multibyte padding works, we may too soon run
	into too short buffers for common terminal widths in graphical
	terminals.

	* compose.c: Use mutt_paddstr() to print compose menu's status line
	rather than printw(). All other menus use mutt_paddstr(): printw()
	prints only N bytes, not N columns.

2007-09-18 11:37 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (5827331565a2)

	* init.h: Document that $charset is a fallback for $send_charset

2007-09-17 17:32 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (ae47263fc1b0)

	* muttlib.c: Enable padding with multibyte chars for %>X, %*X and
	%|X

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, main.c: Include hcache backend version info
	in mutt -v output

	* init.c: Use NONULL to ensure we can pretty-print empty paths for
	option queries

2007-09-14 11:35 -0700  Emanuele  <Emanuele Giaquinta>  (c699e5847630)

	* ChangeLog, configure.ac: The new MD5 code needs AC_C_BIGENDIAN on
	big-endian systems

2007-09-13 09:39 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (154417d57b9d)

	* configure.ac: Do not clobber --with-bdb argument (closes #2955)

2007-09-11 18:33 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (785c95c8ff9a)

	* commands.c: Enlarge error buffer in mutt_enter_command() to not
	truncate option queries. The error buffer gets passed down into
	parse_set() using it to report option values. SHORT_STRING is too
	short to even print some defaults (e.g. $status_format).

	* muttlib.c: Let %*X padding share the same code of %>X padding The
	current implementation of %*X was completely multibyte-unaware and
	had buffer overflow issues with large terminals. Now we use the same
	code as %>X has and optionally only truncate left content to make
	sure the right content can be printed entirely.

2007-09-10 11:14 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (664c5ec1a727)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2007-09-10 08:54 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (49d69399cf21)

	* curs_lib.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Make mutt_FormatString() more
	multibyte-aware As default cause, don't copy raw bytes but copy
	multibyte chars instead to ensure column computation is correct
	(needed for padding).

	* init.c: Escape option values for variable queries and completion
	to ensure they're parsable

2007-09-09 15:48 -0700  Andreas Jaggi  (4e9445a06369)

	* imap/imap.c: Let imap_complete_hosts work with the last mailbox
	(closes #2949). This was an off-by-one error in the mailbox loop.

2007-09-09 15:20 -0700  Julien Cristau  (7e60c2515318)

	* ChangeLog, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Only check whether GNUTLS error is
	fatal when an error occurs (closes #2954). The API for GNUTLS
	changed to require this in 1.7.18.

2007-09-08 15:30 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (1e4a6efddc81)

	* prepare: autoreconf --include doesn't pass its argument to aclocal.
	Let ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS in Makefile.am handle that.

	* configure.ac: Attempt to clean up DB back-end selection

2007-09-06 20:13 +0200  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (648ad3832e82)

	* muttlib.c: Rewrite padding logic for mutt_FormatString()

	Do so by checking columns and bytes individually to make sure we
	really don't write past the end of allocated buffers. This patch
	fixes all my crashes I saw with files attached to/with the settings
	for #2882 and #2900.

2007-09-05 10:52 +0000  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (078744e84667)

	* init.c, pattern.c: Fix/improve intl error messages

	* browser.c: Interpret relative paths in browser relative to shown
	dir, not working dir (closes #2471).

	* help.c, pager.c, pager.h: Teach pager how to ignore $wrap and use it
	for help (closes #2896).

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: make sure <screen/> contents in shorter
	than 80 chars

	Otherwise conversion to plain text may cause line breaks rendering
	examples syntacially invalid (closes #2185).

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Manual: don't use <screen/> to present
	structured data

	* muttlib.c: Fix buffer overflow in mutt_FormatString()

	The variable in question is supposed to track string sizes, not
	string widths (closes #2882 and #2900).

2007-09-04 17:22 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (7df563e4b7fd)

	* configure.ac: Add libz to crypto libs if available
	(closes #2303).

2007-09-04 12:06 -0700  Ivan Vilata i Balaguer  <ivan@selidor.net>  (d9a6b3f8a492)

	* po/ca.po: Updated Catalan translation

2007-08-31 10:12 -0700  Gary  <Gary Johnson>  (791bfed8ba62)

	* editmsg.c: Decrement the mtime of the tempfile during
	edit-message to make mutt notice changes taking less than one
	second.

2007-08-28 11:33 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (3f8829e739e9)

	* init.h: Insert .pp after .de to fix man page generation (closes
	#2940)

	* imap/imap.c: Check subscriptions after any authentication,
	rather than after fist connection (closes #2908)

	* dotlock.c, lib.h, mutt.h: Use limits.h for PATH_MAX instead of
	posix1_lim.h (closes #2525)

2007-08-27 11:07 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (9cfb5ac98e26)

	* imap/auth_cram.c: Update auth_cram for new MD5 code
	(untested).

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, hcache.c, md5.c, md5.h, md5c.c,
	pgppubring.c, pop_auth.c: Replace RFC md5 implementation with GPL
	version from coreutils

2007-08-16 09:32 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (d096219907e7)

	* curs_lib.c: Check for lost tty if getch returns error (closes #1220)
	Great thanks to Vincent Lefevre for tracking this one down.

2007-08-15 20:09 -0700  Michael Vrable  <mvrable@cs.ucsd.edu>  (acd71f2f2555)

	* rfc3676.c: Fix RFC 3676 (format=flowed text) handling.

	The old code would consider a line containing "> " to be flowed, but
	since this is a quoted and space-stuffed line containing no
	additional text, by my reading of RFC 3676 it should be fixed.

	Clean up the handling of format=flowed text. Fix the test to
	determine whether a line is fixed--if a line ends in a space only
	because the last character is a space from space-stuffing, consider
	the line to be a fixed line. This makes the test for ((buf_len -
	buf_off) <= 0) later no longer necessary.

	Also simplify the code by removing checks for curline being non-
	null; it is allocated at the start of the function and never
	reallocated to size zero, so it should never be a null pointer.

2007-08-08 10:49 -0700  Kyle Wheeler  (6d3e90261321)

	* makedoc.c: Trim whitespace in definition lists for man pages (closes
	#2941).

2007-08-02 22:30 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (aefdab8fad80)

	* init.h: Clarify the documentation for $use_envelope_from
	(closes #2936). Thanks to Vincent Lefevre for the suggestions.

2007-07-25 11:16 -0700  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (6bc60516fffa)

	* po/fr.po: Updated French translation.

2007-07-16 10:46 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (bd75134a6b65)

	* enter.c: Make is_shell_char static. Closes #2907.

	* init.c: Check that spam expression has enough matches for its
	template. Closes #2927.

2007-07-14 17:26 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f4b2c6eba5fd)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: GPGME: do not attempt to extract signatures
	unless gpgme_op_verify returned success.

2007-07-09 11:32 -0400  Aron Griffis  <agriffis@n01se.net>  (4e8e3db418ea)

	* send.c: Allow send-hooks to effectively change $from and $use_from

	* mx.c: Clean up mx.c: init stat structs to zero

	prev_sb.st_size was initialized to zero if USE_FCNTL but not if
	USE_FLOCK. Silence the gcc warning for both cases by zeroing the
	stat structures on the stack.

	Other minor cleanups:
	- clean up some whitespace
	- convert return (foo) to return foo
	- return r at the bottom of the function instead of testing values and
	returning them explicitly
	- add vim modeline

2007-07-10 14:47 +0200  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (c06e39893cce)

	* handler.c: Actually bail out, but wiht an ok return value.

	* handler.c: Don't bail out on a bad message/external-body!

2007-07-08 18:27 -0700  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (6241f5669264)

	* commands.c, curs_lib.c, doc/manual.xml.head, init.h, lib.h, menu.c,
	muttlib.c, query.c, recvcmd.c: This patch implements the "%* "
	notation, which is analogous to "%> " but gives precedence to the
	right side instead of to the left when the fill length is zero. The
	default $pager_format is updated to use it so that %P is always
	available at the edge of the screen.

2007-07-08 15:34 -0700  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmund820@rano.org>  (5d74a79deeb3)

	* po/eo.po: Updated Esperanto translation.

2007-07-04 17:36 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (f24fa301493f)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix some compiler warnings in GPGME. Closes #2919.

	* crypt-gpgme.c: GPGME: Stop parsing message as soon as PGP header
	is found. Use file_to_data_object to build data for inline
	signature verification instead of doing it by hand. This fixes
	inline verification for me.

	TODO: crypt-gpgme helper functions seem to return lots of pointers
	off the stack in very dubious ways.

2007-06-27 10:38 -0700  Dan Fandrich  <dan@coneharvesters.com>  (3354ac2e79c7)

	* pager.c: Fix %P in pager status for off_t variability.

	* dotlock.c: remove a double inclusion of config.h

2007-06-14 18:17 -0700  Sertaç Ö. Yıldız  (55cd4cb611d9)

	* rfc3676.c: flowed: consider a single space as a hard line break.

2007-06-09 20:26 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (4b5b42ddfe42)

	* ascii.h, crypt-gpgme.c: Make GPGME backend generate a
	RFC3156-compliant micalg parameter (blush). Based on a patch by
	Stefan Haun. Closes #2901.

2007-06-09 01:03 +0200  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (53e5e1105fd2)

	* sendlib.c: remove unnecessary dprints

2007-06-05 13:12 -0700  pywatson  <pywatson@gmail.com>  (9e90789518ad)

	* sort.c: Make sort by "To" stable (closes #2515).  compare_to()
	calls mutt_get_name(), which may return a static pointer if it in
	turn calls mutt_addr_for_display(). If this static pointer is used
	for a and b, the result is bad. The fix is to make a copy of the
	first object.

2007-05-17 14:40 +0200  Christoph Berg  <cb@df7cb.de>  (edefe5e1f2b4)

	* Muttrc.head: Temporarily set pipe_decode in the \cb urlview macro.

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, hcachever.sh, hcachever.sh.in:
	Use autoconf instead of "which" to discover MD5 tool

2007-05-20 00:29 -0700  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (a0e038310f42)

	* smtp.c: Forget SMTP password if authentication fails.  Thanks to
	Gregory Shapiro for the initial patch (I've moved the reset from
	smtp_auth_sasl up to smtp_auth, and used the account API instead
	of twiddling account bits by hand). Closes #2872.

2007-05-15 21:05 +0200  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (33af2883d52b)

	notice to stderr). smime.c: fflush() before rewind(). Closes #2428.

	* Makefile.am, build-release, mkchangelog.sh: Fix up release

	* lib.c: safe_rename: fall back to rename on ENOSYS and EPERM as well
	as EXDEV. sshfs returns ENOSYS when attempting cross-directory
	links. vfat returns EPERM.

	* lib.c: Make safe_open with O_EXCL friendlier for NFS. Per #2707,
	when an open file is moved into a different directory over NFS, it
	may leave a .nfsXXX hardlink behind. This causes the rmdir in
	safe_open to fail, leaving tempdir droppings around. This patch
	works around the problem by closing the file after creating it and
	reopening it after rename.

	segfault in the new mboxcache hcache lookup. idata may not have an

	* hcache.c: hcache: prepend current dir to path for local folders If a
	folder is local (i.e. stat() succeeds), prepend the current working
	directory if necessary to always fully qualify the path. Otherwise
	we may end up using different cache files for the same folder when
	given relative paths. This closes #2845.

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/manual.xml.head: Make manual validate against
	DocBook 4.2 DTD for "book" This adds a 'validate' target to
	doc/Makefile which uses xmllint(1) to validate manual.xml against
	the DTD given in the doctype (intended for developers only).

	1) We declare 'article' as the doctype but want to use 'book' 2)
	Within a lists's items, we didn't include our text in a paragraph

	* Makefile.am: Run cut under the C locale when parsing ChangeLog
	for reldate.

2006-06-13 07:52:52  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (roessler)

	* cryptglue.c: typo

2006-06-08 11:56:05  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* commands.c, curs_main.c, globals.h, muttlib.c, sendlib.c: Clean
	up ReleaseDate mess; include ReleaseDate in User-Agent header.

	* crypt.c: Fix #2272.

2006-06-06 23:58:10  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Remove variable aliases from the output of mutt -D
	(modified for dubious cosmetic reasons). Closes: #2265.

2006-05-26 16:51:48  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: When flags are added to CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS in
	configure.in, this should be done with a consistent
	order. Otherwise, when several versions of a library are
	installed, this could lead to a mismatch between the header and
	the library.

2006-05-26 16:38:18  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/message.c, mutt_socket.c, mutt_socket.h,
	pop_lib.c: Add mutt_socket_write_n to write binary data. Use this
	function in imap_append_message. Closes: #2244.

2006-05-21 23:25:48  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* .cvsignore, reldate.h: reldate.h is a generated file now: remove
	reldate.h from version control, and add it to .cvsignore.

2006-05-19 20:38:05  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Add intro.html to distributed HTML files
	(fallout from conversion from article to book).

	* UPDATING: Use +/-/! instead of N/D/M in UPDATING.

2006-05-19 18:30:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, README, UPDATING: The UPDATING document is supposed
	(when complete) to provide quick pointers by date to changed
	features (new options/commands, new features, changed defaults,
	etc.)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.h: Document speed impact of attachment
	counting. This adds a short paragraph to manual.xml and
	cross-links %X-expandos to it.

2006-05-18 18:35:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, mh.c: Use
	header_cache_t* instead of void* for header cache.

	In hcache.c, the header_cache structure is defined to match the
	needs per DB backend used. Thus the interface uses void* abstract
	from it. This patch adds a 'header_cache' forward declaration to
	hcache.h so that we at least get a little more type safety.

	* INSTALL: Note that the DocBook 4.2 DTD should be installed
	locally in order to build the manual.

	* doc/chunk.xsl, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/manual.xml.tail,
	makedoc.c: Properly use tables in manual where appropriate.

	Now, lots of information which really deserves a table is just put
	into <screen/> sections with manual line breaks and things like
	that. This is ugly for several reasons including that the
	information stored there should be accessable straight from the
	table of contents. For the TOC, this patch switches to <book/> for the manual and uses a
        deeper split level so things actually look nicer. The only problem
	are tables which may be not so well supported when dumping the
	HTML to .txt but the DocBook->txt converter with table support is
	work-in-progress...

	* imap/message.c, imap/utf7.c, imap/util.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c,
	muttlib.c, mx.c, pager.c, pgplib.c, remailer.c, rfc1524.c,
	rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c, rfc822.c, sendlib.c, buffy.c, charset.c,
	check_sec.sh, color.c, enter.c, group.c, hash.c, init.c, lib.c,
	menu.c, mh.c, mutt_idna.c: Avoid safe_free() usage and add
	security checks.

	Add checks to check_sec.sh for memory functions. These include a
	check for use of safe_free() instead of FREE() and a check whether
	FREE(&...) is used. For the former, __SAFE_FREE_CHECKED__ is to be
	used, for the latter __FREE_CHECKED__ to avoid messages from
	check_sec.sh

2006-05-18 08:53:31  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* Makefile.am, build-release, reldate.h: Autogenerate reldate.h
	from ChangeLog.

2006-05-17 18:37:33  Rene Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (brendan)

	* po/nl.po: Updated nl.po.

2006-05-16 05:01:02  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Updated fr.po

2006-05-06 07:42:51  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* mh.c: Header caching for mh folders.

2006-05-05 17:27:10  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Set system ID to docbook 4.2, in harmony
	with schema URL.

2006-05-02 22:23:35  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Fix an improper dereference in mutt_buffer_init (I think).

2006-04-28 19:52:45  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* mutt.h, parse.c, pattern.c, protos.h, hdrline.c: Cleaning
	up attachment counting.  This takes away some of the worst
	aberrations, but the feature is still a performance hog.

2006-04-28 12:19:20  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (roessler)

	* mutt_socket.h: "could somebody please move this really nasty
	bug fix taken from Brendan's esmtp patch to the mailine code?" --
	"done"

2006-04-28 08:35:03  Rocco Rutte  <pdmef@gmx.net>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c, init.h, main.c, mutt.h, mutt_socket.c, mutt_ssl.c,
	mutt_ssl.h, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c, pop_lib.c, buffy.c, configure.in,
	globals.h, init.c: pdmef+fix+sslinterface. Triggered by a warning
	when compiling with POP and GNUTLS, I noticed the SSL interfaces
	for OpenSSL and GNUTLS internally are different which doesn't
	make sense.

	* configure.in, mh.c: pdmef+fix+dino.diff. This fixes mutt/2174.

2006-04-24 19:59:07  exg@gentoo.org  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Don't abort configure if --without-sasl is
	given without any network options. Gentoo's build scripts seem
	to generate this configuration.

2006-04-20 16:46:49  Moritz.Schulte@ruhr-uni-bochum.de  (roessler)

	* headers.c, mutt_crypt.h, postpone.c: Make mutt_parse_crypt_hdr
	more SMIME-aware.

2006-04-18 23:22:30  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: Handle Exchange's bogus short challenge in
	AUTH NTLM (problem debugged by Alexander Gattin).

2006-04-18 15:28:50  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* recvattach.c: Fix saving of attachments.

2006-04-05 17:28:30  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c:	(1) OP_MAIN_LINK_THREADS needs to check for
	IMAP_ACL_DELETE permission, since the thread linking involves
	deleting the old email. (2) makes CHECK_IMAP_ACL() a no-op if
	USE_IMAP is not defined; then cleans up a bunch of the #ifdef
	litter.

2006-04-03 20:26:14  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c: Don't pass a null destination to imap_fix_path
	in the default STATUS handler when the mailbox name is implicitly
	INBOX. Thanks to Kai Hendry for the test mailbox and Sami Liedes
	for the backtrace. Closes debian #351337.

	* init.h: Set $record default to ~/sent (closes: #2068).

2006-03-30 19:50:01  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Tighten up lists/subscribe example,
	to close #2198.

2006-03-28 18:04:21  Mike Hallock  <mhallock@scs.uiuc.edu>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: imap-fetch-mail should check that there is a
	Context before dereferencing Context->magic to avoid a segfault
	possibility.

2006-03-28 01:08:28  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* recvattach.c: Sanitize attachment file names (seatbelt for
	inattentive recipients).

2006-03-24 23:15:37  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>  (brendan)

	* INSTALL: Document the need for a docbook-xsl bundle in order
	to build the docs.

2006-03-15 12:26:00  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Don't store UIDNEXT unless we know it.

	* imap/message.c: Only synthesize UIDNEXT if we've fetched
	uncached messages. Fixes a FETCH 1:0 bug Bruno Postle reported and
	helped to debug.

2006-03-13 23:21:51  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Courier fails to send UIDNEXT on SELECT
	(a violation of RFC 3501 section 6.3.1) - synthesize it if it
	is missing.

	* init.h: Make imap_idle default to false for 1.5.12.

2006-03-03 10:12:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* hook.c: reply-hook is used in contexts where we don't have
	a Context structure available. Hence, it must not require the
	full message.

2006-03-03 09:55:46  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* query.c: Fix mutt/2189; lack of error checking in the query
	code.

2006-02-21 21:52:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Preallocate some buffer space before attempting
	vsnprintf in mutt_buffer_printf (Solaris 9 workaround).

2006-02-21 08:10:15  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* attach.c: Fix mutt/2186.

2006-02-21 00:29:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, muttlib.c: Catch mutt_buffer_printf failures.

2006-01-26 07:13:06  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>  (brendan)

	* contrib/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Set datarootdir.

2006-01-20 21:21:31  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Correct a fairly harmless typo parsing message
	\Recent flags.

2006-01-15 21:37:03  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h, main.c,
	pattern.c: A conservative update of copyright years. Some other
	files may need updating too.

2006-01-14 01:16:59  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Tab-completion for my_ variable names and values.

2006-01-13 09:08:11  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* init.c: More compact code for managing the "my" variables list.

2006-01-12 19:09:28  Phil Pennock  <mutt-dev@spodhuis.demon.nl>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Update MyVars to the next entry when deleting the head
	of the list, instead of leaving it pointing to a freed entry.

2006-01-12 09:36:46  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* po/fr.po: update

2006-01-12 06:07:50  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Teach mutt to expand mutt variables as it does
	environment variables. For example, you might put something like
	this into a hook: set sendmail="mysmtp -f $from". Allow
	user-definable variables starting with my_. Environment variables
	take precedence, and expansion does not occur in shell-escape.

2006-01-11 06:45:23  Recai Oktas  <roktas@omu.edu.tr>  (brendan)

	* po/tr.po: A tr.po update.

2006-01-10 21:06:22  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c: Sanity-check folder inferiors response. Brian
	Weaver reports that it fixes the extra delimiters bug triggered by
	dbmail's incorrect LIST response.

	* hdrline.c: Don't use uninitialised flags variable when fetching
	attachment count.  Closes: #2153.

2006-01-09 19:43:59  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c, mutt.h, pattern.c, protos.h, send.c, Makefile.am,
	globals.h, group.c, init.c, init.h: Adding pattern group support;
	see http://does-not-exist.org/mail-archives/mutt-dev/msg05693.html
	for instructions.  The ungroup command is not yet implemented,
	and documentation is lacking.

2006-01-04 17:28:32  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c: Zero out IMAP_LIST before each imap_cmd_step in
	browser to avoid bogus matches when the untagged response isn't a
	LIST response. Phil Pennock diagnosed and proposed a patch for
	this bug.

2006-01-03 17:35:18  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Pipeline CLOSE (it's always followed by a SELECT or
	a LOGOUT).

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: If there is an * OK
	[CAPABILITY... qualifier on connect, parse it and skip the manual
	capability check.

	* imap/imap.h, imap/imap.c, postpone.c: Pipeline postponed mail
	check on mailbox open if appropriate.

2005-12-30 17:34:52  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Sort mailbox in SORT_ORDER in imap_sync_mailbox so
	that sync_helper doesn't end up resorting it 10 times.

	* imap/imap.c: Only resort headers in imap_make_msg_set if order
	!= SORT_ORDER. Fix sync_helper to return 1 in case of +FLAGS but
	not -FLAGS.

2005-12-26 23:55:19  Nik A. Melchior  <nam1@cec.wustl.edu>  (brendan)

	* doc/muttrc.man.head: Fix whitespace around ~X in
	muttrc.man.head.

2005-12-23 18:20:02  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Don't evaluate hcache
	unless uidnext > 0. This shouldn't happen, but it was reported
	to. I probably have to be a lot more careful about the uid
	datatypes but I'm too lazy to clean up right now.

	* imap/imap.c: Always use NOOP when imap_check_mailbox is called
	with force set. Seems to resolve a Cyrus idiosyncracy noted by
	Phil Pennock.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/message.c: IMAP message cache fixes: embed
	UIDVALIDITY in the cache file name, only delete deleted messages
	at sync time. Also use an alias to make the sync code clearer.

2005-12-22 20:14:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c: Fix at least Kyle Wheeler's new mail detection
	problems: call imap_fix_path on buffy path.

	* regex.c: Kyle Wheeler noticed a couple of warnings in the
	moribund regex code. One still remains that I'm too lazy to fix
	right now.

	* imap/message.c: Add <errno.h> for msg_cache_put.

	* globals.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c,
	imap/message.h, init.h: Add $imap_cachedir option. If set, mutt
	will keep copies of IMAP messages under this directory.

	* imap/imap.c: Check all connections instead of just the first
	when NONEW is set in imap_conn_find. Wait for root delimiter check
	to complete before SELECTing since we may need it to form the
	mailbox name.

	* imap/command.c: More logging in STATUS parser to track down new
	mail detection problems.

2005-12-21 21:02:50  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c: Check for NULL data in refactored mutt_hcache_fetch.

	* hcache.c: Unbreak QDBM too.

	* hcache.c, hcache.h: I broke DB4 while refactoring hcache.c.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: Cache
	UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT as header cache metadata, only attempt to
	fetch up to UIDNEXT from the header cache. Also a cosmetic
	correction: Display the actual first message being fetched (after
	hcache) instead of 1.

	* imap/command.c: Don't run pending IMAP commands until the
	current queue has drained. Many thanks to Vincent Lefevre for his
	patient help debugging.

	* imap/command.c: Compare full mailbox names when doing IMAP buffy
	check, not up to the length of the STATUS response.

2005-12-20 17:50:47  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* hcache.c, hcache.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, mh.c, protos.h, Makefile.am: Refactor header cache
	a bit to provide (fetch|store)_raw functions. These will let me
	keep folder metadata (UIDVALIDITY, NEXT, msg count etc) in the
	cache, which will help to sync more quickly.

	* imap/imap.c: Remove deleted entries from header cache on CLOSE.

2005-12-19 18:13:28  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: ChangeLog.old was just old ChangeLog
	entries with different formatting - I think it's time to put it
	out to pasture. I've moved all pre-1.4 entries from ChangeLog into
	ChangeLog.old now. This should have the nice side-effect of making
	the git mirror grow a little more slowly.

	* imap/imap.c: Catch another possible race when starting IDLE.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c: More IMAP
	header cache cleanup: remove expunged entries from cache, and
	don't bother checking the cache for mail that's arrived since the
	mailbox was opened. TODO: cache UIDNEXT, only check the cache for
	messages up to cached value.

	* imap/imap.c: Avoid a possible race when entering the IDLE
	command - if new mail notification is received before the +
	response, mutt may attempt to send a fetch command before it
	realises it's idling.

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/imap.c: Much faster
	IMAP sync code, pipelined and everything. Now batch updates
	changed flags, instead of syncing each changed message
	individually.

	* imap/imap.c: Manually unidle at logout if necessary. Somewhat
	unclean - might be good to have an imap_unidle function...

	* imap/imap.c, imap/message.c, imap/message.h: Cache server-side
	flags, don't send flag updates if mutt's are the same. This can
	happen if a flag is toggled and toggled back, or we receive server
	updates, and the cache will make much faster sync possible later.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c: Pipeline MYRIGHTS, subscribed
	mailbox check and root delimiter check.

	* imap/imap.c: Clear name field from status callback before each
	IMAP completion attempt.

	* imap/message.c: Remove some cut-n-paste garbage from IMAP header
	cache code.

	* mx.c: Only mark unread messages as old when closing mailbox.

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/browse.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/util.c, mx.c: Real
	support for the Old flag on IMAP.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h: Display success message when
	subscription command succeeds.

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h:
	Replace imap_parse_list_response with a proper untagged response
	handler.

2005-12-16 18:49:40  Recai Oktas  <roktas@omu.edu.tr>  (brendan)

	* color.c, crypt.c, handler.c, init.c, parse.c, smime.c: Use
	ascii_str* instead of mutt_str* in several places where it's
	needed.

2005-12-16 18:18:52  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, imap/util.c: New new mail detection code. Now we
	use UIDVALIDITY/UIDNEXT to detect whether a mailbox has been
	changed since we last saw it, rather than the more ephemeral
	RECENT flag. We also keep a cache of mailboxes we've visited or
	called STATUS on, which might eventually make for better
	information in the browser and mailbox views. Big changes,
	probably not stable. IWFM.

2005-12-15 18:59:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/message.c: Whitespace shuffling.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c:
	Use mutt_buffer_printf in several places instead of a homebrew
	version.

	* configure.in, m4/funcs.m4, muttlib.c, protos.h: Add
	mutt_buffer_printf function, with autoconf test for va_copy.

	* imap/imap.c: IMAP keepalive might have been interacting badly
	with $timeout when IDLE was enabled. Use force option for IDLE too.

2005-12-14 17:29:57  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap_private.h: SASL-IR
	support for IMAP. The RTT was has begun. I had forgotten how
	strangely convoluted auth_sasl has become though...

2005-12-13 23:37:42  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_ssl.c, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Add conn_poll (using
	raw_socket_poll) to SSL socket setup functions.

	* buffy.c: Fix recently-broken buffy notification for IMAP.

	* imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, postpone.c: Restore IMAP postponed check in the wake
	of the buffy pipelining patch. Fall back to NOOP if IDLE poll
	fails. Allow for untagged messages when starting IDLE. Free
	idata->cmdbuf in imap_free_idata.

	* imap/TODO, imap/BUGS: Updated todo/bug list for IMAP

2005-12-12 17:24:12  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h, mutt.h: Add $imap_idle
	boolean to disable the IDLE extension (may be needed with some
	servers like the particular version of dovecot I tried
	yesterday). Don't attempt to poll mailboxes with connections that
	haven't yet authenticated. Recognize NO responses again (silly
	typo, spotted by Charlie Allom)

2005-12-12 02:24:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	mutt_socket.c, mutt_socket.h, mutt_tunnel.c: IMAP IDLE support.

	* buffy.c: Whoops, don't break buffy for non-IMAP mailboxes!

	* buffy.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c: IMAP command batching code, used
	to pipeline mailbox poll requests. Up to 10 poll commands will be
	sent at a time (tunable in imap_private.h). This is a huge win on
	my currently awful wireless link. It takes a knife to a lot of
	fundamental IMAP code (mostly for the better), so it may have
	destabilised things. Time for some brave (or lazy
	non-Changelog-reading) testers to report... next up, IDLE
	support.

2005-12-10 07:06:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/util.c: Set up a command pipeline. Currently everything still
	runs a single command from start to finish before moving on, but
	this creates the infrastructure to pipeline mailbox polling
	calls. Bitter experience at the end of a flaky wireless link
	teaches me that this can be useful.

	* imap/auth_anon.c, imap/auth_cram.c, imap/auth_gss.c,
	imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap_private.h, imap/message.c, imap/util.c: Move IMAP
	response buffer out of command into IMAP_DATA. Ironically this is
	to prepare for pipelined commands.

2005-11-24 12:50:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* curs_main.c, pattern.c: mutt/2142 suggests that the change
	from pattern.c,3.14 -> 3.15 causes inconsistency and confusion.
	Reverting the change; adding a helpful message to the status line.

2005-11-22 12:31:58  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* pgp.c: Fix "mixed messages" about the success (or not) of
	decrypting PGP messages.

	* handler.c: Actually, the previous fix for 2139 had a flaw.

	* handler.c: Fix mutt/2139; also Debian #340116.

2005-11-17 18:40:50  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* menu.c: a not entirely sane state of code.

	* menu.c: Another stab at #2019.

2005-11-01 08:42:00  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* menu.c: This should be a better patch for the menu break
	dance. (#2019)

2005-10-31 11:56:58  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>  (roessler)

	* imap/message.c: Fix 2119.

2005-10-31 10:51:54  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* mutt_idna.c: Fix the underlying problem behind mutt/2107.

	* menu.c: Fixing #2019.

	* flags.c: Fix #2123.

2005-10-21 04:35:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c, attach.c, buffy.c, copy.c, copy.h, crypt-gpgme.c,
	crypt.c, edit.c, handler.c, mbox.c, mutt.h, pager.c, parse.c,
	pattern.c, pgp.c, pgpmicalg.c, pgppacket.c, pgppubring.c, pop.c,
	postpone.c, protos.h, sendlib.c: Full large file support. Keep a
	close watch on your mailboxes everyone!

2005-10-18 07:04:50  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (roessler)

	* po/fr.po: update

2005-10-17 09:14:58  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (roessler)

	* smime.c: Fix S/MIME algorithm choice.

2005-10-14 09:30:11  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c: Fix imap/2112.

2005-10-10 18:26:31  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: Make PGP decode failure non-fatal when displaying
	messages (as opposed to decode-saving them). I think it would be
	nicer to include the original text when decryption fails
	though...

	* imap/command.c, setenv.c: Accept + as IMAP continuation, not
	just + . May close #2106. Feed check_sec candy in setenv.c.

2005-10-09 20:53:21  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Now that we always check for ncurses/ncurses.h,
	remove /usr special case.

	* configure.in, mutt_curses.h: Tweak ncurses autoconflation to
	check for ncurses/ncurses.h everywhere, not just in /usr. With
	--with-curses=/usr/local, should Close: #2095.

	* configure.in, setenv.c: Add Russ Allbery's setenv replacement
	function.

	* init.h: Correct doc nit for $meta_key, noted by Mark
	Weyer. Closes: #2105.

2005-10-06 06:15:00  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* browser.c: Sort browser entries after every IMAP browsing
	operation instead of just when explicitly requested. Closes:
	#2089.

2005-10-06 05:13:55  Jeff Ito  <jeffi@rcn.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c: Add AES ciphers to S/MIME encryption options. Closes:
	#2103.

2005-10-05 19:24:40  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, init.c: Fix 'unattachments'. Closes: #2102.

2005-10-05 19:20:22  Jeff Ito  <jeffi@rcn.com>  (brendan)

	* smime.c: S/MIME key selection truncates the last character of
	the selected key for no apparent reason. Removed until someone
	can justify it. Closes: #2081.

2005-10-04 19:00:05  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.h: Tweak description of pop_checkinterval slightly. Closes:
	#2074.

	* hcache.c: Bump hcache Id for attachment counting patch.

2005-10-04 06:05:39  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* Muttrc.head.in, doc/manual.xml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head,
	globals.h, hdrline.c, init.c, init.h, mime.h, mutt.h, parse.c,
	pattern.c, protos.h, recvattach.c: Attachment counting for index
	display (patch-1.5.11.dgc.attach.6). Modifications: attach_recurse
	and attach_ignore_fundamental stripped, some debugging code
	removed, some bones thrown to check_sec.sh.

2005-10-04 05:24:00  Sébastien Hinderer  <Sebastien.Hinderer@libertysurf.fr>  (brendan)

	* pager.c: The following patch has an effect only when the
	braille_friendly variable is set. When this is the case, the
	cursor is put on the first line of the message body, when viewing
	it with the pager.

2005-10-04 04:29:09  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Piping and printing in IMAP folder index with
	imap_peek=no marks message read immediately.

2005-10-03 07:52:00  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (roessler)

	* curs_lib.c, send.c: fix a problem that appears with signatures
	without newline.

2005-09-30 18:24:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/devel-notes.txt: Change manual.sgml to manual.xml (noted
	by Alain Bench).

2005-09-30 01:42:50  Roland Rosenfeld  <roland@spinnaker.de>  (brendan)

	* po/de.po: Update.

2005-09-29 23:57:07  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Update.

2005-09-29 23:52:16  pi  <pi@beobide.net>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, po/eu.po: Basque translation.

2005-09-29 23:02:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, copy.c, sendlib.c: Ensure that Content-Length
	printf format specifier matches off_t size, to avoid mail-losing
	Content-Length: 0 (bug introduced by large file patch a couple
	of days ago). Closes: #2096.

2005-09-27 03:43:24  Johan Svedberg  <johan@svedberg.com>  (brendan)

	* po/sv.po: Update.

2005-09-24 20:03:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* edit.c: Inflict more needless pain on translators by splitting
	EditorHelp to satisfy -pedantic.

	* mbox.c, mutt.h, configure.in: Use fseeko/ftello when available
	while opening mbox/mmdf. Closes: #2084.

2005-09-24 19:36:35  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* copy.c, mutt.h, parse.c, sendlib.c, thread.c: Cosmetic fixes to
	MIME headers. Closes: #2086.

2005-09-24 17:51:17  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* po/ja.po: Update to HEAD.

2005-09-23 18:38:36  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* configure.in: Quote an error message.

2005-09-22 16:38:08  Takahashi Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, globals.h, hcache.c, init.h: Update QDBM patch to
	the current state of the art. Closes: #2003 (again).

2005-09-22 09:06:13  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>  (roessler)

	* send.c: When composing a reply, there might be degenerate cases
	in which a CC header is created, but no To header.  In this case,
	we now use the auto-generated CC header as the To header.

2005-09-22 04:05:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Refactor mutt var completion so it can be used for
	inline expansions (eg $from). Actual expansion not committed yet.

	* send.c: If ContentType is null, assume text/plain. Stopgap; a
	better mechanism would sanity-check MuttVars assignments before
	allowing them. Closes: #2080.

	* imap/util.c, imap/imap.c: Don't allow imap URLs with empty
	hosts. Also don't attempt to complete on open connections when
	there aren't any (diagnosed by Nico Golde). Closes: #2079.

	* pattern.c: Use ctx instead of Context when checking whether or
	not to do IMAP search. Resolves a possible segfault in color index
	~b operations. I can't remember whether Context vs ctx was
	intentional - I doubt it.

2005-09-21 14:17:14  Adeodato Simo  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Check for sigwinch in index before calling
	km_dokey, since for unknown reasons km_dokey seems to eat the
	signal in some cases. [Not reproducible in my ncurses environments
	- Brendan]. Closes: #1907.

2005-09-21 13:23:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, pattern.c: Catch empty substring/regexp search
	arguments (precludes a segfault from dereferencing a null string
	pointer later).

2005-09-21 06:04:37  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>  (roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, configure.in, hcache.c: QDBM support for the
	header cache.

2005-09-21 04:50:31  Adeodato Simo  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: When using GPG agent in classic mode, set GPG_TTY if it
	isn't already set instead of bailing out. Closes: #2072.

2005-09-21 03:48:38  Takahashi Tamotsu  <ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Ensure that set doesn't change variables from within the
	help screen. I think this is a gross approach, and probably
	overkill, but it's the fault of the original code design, not
	Tamo's patch. Until a better way falls from the sky, this Closes:
	#2011.

2005-09-21 02:58:07  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c: Cancelling <change-folder> from within the pager
	will now keep you in the pager rather than kicking you back to the
	index. Closes: #2075.

2005-09-20 23:41:21  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* muttlib.c: Slight improvement on dgc's warning fix in edge cases.

2005-09-20 06:43:39  David Champion  <dgc@uchicago.edu>  (brendan)

	* init.c: Fix a null-pointer-dereference parsing aliases with
	-d3+.

	* muttlib.c: Clear a compiler warning.

2005-09-20 03:56:25  Gero Treuner  <gerotick@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de>  (brendan)

	* contrib/gpg.rc, doc/manual.xml.tail: Update locations of
	gpg-2comp, Gero Treuner.

2005-09-19 06:14:27  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mkchangelog.sh: I just realised what's been happening to the
	changelog: I recently got a new version of 'head' that refuses
	to accept -1 instead of -n 1, but doesn't actually return
	failure. So mkchangelog was feeding nothing to the cvs date
	argument, and instead merrily snarfing down the entire changelog
	every time. I've put in a simple $date != "" check. Thanks,
	textutils!  Thanks for ushering in the future! I'd like to shake
	your hand. Hard.

2005-09-19 05:12:29  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Remove mention of obsolete
	--enable-imap-edit-threads configure option.

2005-09-18 17:49:33  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* ChangeLog: Somehow the changelog got mangled (multiple copies
	of large parts).

2005-09-18 08:22:49  Vsevolod Volkov  <vvv@mutt.org.ua>  (roessler)

	* po/ru.po: update

2005-09-18 02:53:18  brendan  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: More cleanups, slightly better dependencies.

2005-09-18 02:35:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Stupid hack to synchronise on makedoc for
	parallel builds. Only works when entered via make all. make
	stamp-doc-xml directly can fail in pathological conditions.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Attempt to work around make -j2
	breakage. Dependencies are still wrong, but I don't have
	the brainpower right now to get it right. People talk about
	imperative, functional, and logic programming, but no one ever
	mentions make programming.

	* Muttrc.head.in: Clean up some Muttrc macros, and add macro
	'y' to jump to the mailboxes view. Closes: #2069.

2005-09-17 17:27:54  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* main.c: Some minor cleanups: tell users to go to bugs.mutt.org
	instead of using flea; update copyright year in mutt -v;
	reorganise USE opts a little; break long strings so that -pedantic
	stops complaining. Not sure that last one is worth the trouble
	it causes the po team...

2005-09-17 01:07:54  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* po/fr.po: Update.

2005-09-16 23:09:12  Kevin Scannell  <scannell@slu.edu>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, po/ga.po: Irish translation.

2005-09-16 15:20:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* build-release, po/Makefile.in.in: Move update-po out of make
	dist, into build-release. It seems to me that make dist should do
	as little as possible beyond putting the right files in a tarball.

2005-09-16 13:43:58  Ronny Haryanto  <ronnylist@haryan.to>  (roessler)

2005-09-16 02:15:45  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Add stamp-doc-xml to "all".

	* doc/Makefile.in: stamp-doc-man is pointless as far as I can
	tell. Removed.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Tweak makefile so that the dist tarball
	doesn't always try to build docs.

	* configure.in: VERSION should go into CONFIG_STATUS_DEPENDENCIES,
	not CONFIGURE_DEPENDENCIES. Slap ma fro.

2005-09-15 23:18:48  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, build-release: Move changelog target to
	update-changelog so that dist won't automatically invoke it,
	and have commit and build-release call it.

	* build-release: Now that 1.5.11 is out, previous versions won't
	be x.y.zi: adjust diff.

	* init.h: Refer to $use_envelope_from rather than old
	$envelope_from in description of $envelope_from_address.

2005-09-14 02:45:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* globals.h, init.h, sendlib.c: Add new $envelope_from_address
	variable for manually specifying the envelope sender. Rename (with
	compatibility synonym) $envelope_from to $use_envelope_from. Make
	$envelope_from subordinate to $use_e_f, as $from is to
	$use_from. From a discussion with TLR.

2005-09-13 20:36:17  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in: Put chunked HTML manual in top doc directory
	instead of HTML subdirectory.  Solves a weird $distdir
	absolute/relative path nuisance.

2005-09-12 06:22:21  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_lib.c, pop.c, pop.h, pop_lib.c: Teach pop driver about
	mutt_progress_bar. Allow progress bar to omit total size if zero
	(=unknown).

2005-09-10 06:02:04  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, curs_lib.c: A pair of small optimisations to the
	progress bar.

2005-09-08 16:37:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pager.c: Revert bogus change to last message detection in
	mutt_pager.

	* pager.c: Forget line number when resolving in pager. This
	is beginning to get messy - maybe it would be better to only
	remember on specific operations like sync.

	* mutt_socket.c: Set CLOEXEC on sockets in IPv4 code path like
	we do in IPv6.

	* pattern.c: Make stringmatch pattern detection stateless.

	* curs_lib.c: ifdef USE_SOCKET around mutt_progress_bar.

2005-09-07 08:01:59  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* curs_lib.c: Ensure progress bar rounds to $net_inc.

	* curs_lib.c, globals.h, imap/imap.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, init.h, mutt_curses.h: Display progress meter
	when uploading/fetching IMAP data. Closes: #1772.

	* pager.c: Adjust gross hack to return to the same line in the
	pager after an index operation so that it doesn't shoot past the
	end of the file if there are fewer lines on return (eg when weed
	is set).

	* mx.c, pgp.c: Silence some GCC warnings about uninitialized
	variables.

	* build-release, configure.in, mutt.h: Remove international
	vs. U.S. distribution distinction. build-release expects the
	previous version to be x.y.zi and should be updated again
	for 1.5.12.

2005-09-06 16:46:44  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: More documentation cosmetics (newlines
	between Usage: lines).

	* pager.c: Gross hack to return to the same line in the pager
	after executing an index function. Closes: #1210.

	* doc/manual.xml.head, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/imap.h,
	init.c, mutt.h, pattern.c: Extend pattern language to do simple
	string matches as well as regular expressions when the pattern
	is invoked with = instead of ~. And, when possible, perform
	full body searches on the IMAP server instead of locally, for
	an enormous speed boost.

	* imap/utf7.c, init.c, main.c, protos.h: Fix a memory leak in
	imap_utf7_decode and do a little cleanup on shutdown.  Get a
	high five from valgrind.

	* curs_main.c, main.c: Move SASL and IMAP shutdown hooks into
	main where they belong.

	* init.c: Release pwent after extracting data from it.

	* mutt_sasl.h, curs_main.c, mutt_sasl.c: Release global SASL
	state when quitting.

2005-09-05 04:22:45  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Documentation cosmetics (add some line
	breaks).

2005-09-04 20:10:25  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* init.h: Point $hide_top_limited to $hide_limited instead of
	$hide_missing. Likewise for $hide_top_missing. Closes: #2039.

	* init.h: Mention $sort_re in $strict_threads
	documentation. Closes: #2052.

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Add a push example. Closes: #1591.

2005-09-04 19:46:26  Rupert Levene  <rupert@levene.dyndns.org>	(brendan)

2005-09-04 06:57:04  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head, doc/manual.xml.tail: Note that <Tab>
	is bound to next-new-then-unread by default, rather than
	next-new. Closes: #1637.

	* curs_main.c, pattern.c: Allow empty limits, and limits in
	empty mailboxes. Closes: #1853, #1906.

2005-09-03 23:22:31  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* send.c, attach.c: Note when mutt_edit_attachment fails and

	file. Closes: #2051.

2005-09-03 19:41:53  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* contrib/gpg.rc: One should let GnuPG charset be automatically

2005-09-03 04:34:25  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.xml.head: Just use EXPR as a place holder for regular

	by Vincent Lefevre.

	to manual.xml.*.

2005-09-02 18:18:19  Alain Bench  <veronatif@free.fr>  (brendan)

	* keymap.c: Allow non-ascii characters in push arguments. Closes:
	#2023.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head, mutt.h, pattern.c:
	Adjust ~l to match all known lists, add ~u to match only

	* configure.in, imap/auth_sasl.c, main.c, mutt_sasl.c,

	* doc/chunk.xsl, doc/html.xsl: Docbook support files, dropped
	in the initial commit.

	* doc/manual.sgml.tail, configure.in, doc/Makefile.in,
	doc/manual.sgml.head, makedoc.c: Convert documentation from

	as fatal.

2005-08-22 20:30:11  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* pgp.c: Pause after error message if PGP decode fails, in case
	mutt_copy_message overwrites.  Real error handling cleanup will
	have to wait...

	* pgp.c: Don't attempt to manipulate null pgp output file handles.

2005-08-16 18:10:11  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>	(brendan)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/mutt.man, main.c: -D dumps to stdout,

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Turn off input buffering for gnutls SSL

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: Override SASL initial response if the server
	spoke first in its continuation response. Closes: #2034.

	* doc/Makefile.in: Degnuify mutt.1 make rule. Imagining a world

2005-08-11 01:44:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_sasl.c: Silence some compiler warnings.

2005-08-09 20:13:03  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/manual.sgml.tail: Replace raw latin1
	characters with entities, and enable latin output for
	manual.txt. I'm not sure this is ideal for non-latin (eg
	utf8) environments, but hopefully docbook will resolve this
	anyway. Closes: #2029.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Replace free ~ with &tilde;. Closes:
	#2030.

	* pgp.c: Move pgp failure check inside the if (invoke pgp)
	block. Should really Close: 2032.

	* pgp.c: Don't ftell pgp output file if there isn't one. Closes:

2005-08-09 16:10:40  Mads Martin Joergensen  <mmj@suse.de>  (brendan)

	* copy.c: Remove an unneeded cast, which introduces
	type-punning. Modified to use FREE instead of safe_free, since
	that seems to be the convention. I personally don't see the point.

2005-08-08 18:59:43  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_socket.c: Pause for a moment when a hostname fails to
	resolve. Closes #1942.	There are a number of cases where mutt
	cascades error messages. It might be nice if there were an error
	stack so that low level functions could push_error instead of
	displaying it right away, and the higher level ones could eg
	mutt_message(_("Failed to write FCC: %s"), pop_error ())...

	* main.c: Document -d option in mutt -h output. Closes #2027.

	* init.h: Remove undefined reference to unmailboxes
	command. Closes #2028.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix edge case where we might have to wait two
	timeouts to check for IMAP mail.

	* imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h: Fix bug just introduced
	in lsub parsing that could cause mutt to loop indefinitely.
	Don't recheck subscriptions at every mailbox change, just the
	initial connection.

	* imap/imap.c: If imap_check_subscribed is set, mailbox or
	unmailbox folders in response to subscribe/unsubscribe commands
	in the browser.

2005-08-07 23:52:08  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, init.h, mutt.h:
	New option: $imap_check_subscribed. If set, mutt will fetch the
	set of subscribed mailboxes from the server and add them to the
	buffy list.

	* browser.c: Avoid a segfault attempting to browse an invalid
	IMAP URL.

	* imap/imap.c: Extend IMAP host completion to complete over open
	connections. Next up: account and folder hooks.

	* imap/imap.c: Allow IMAP tab-completion to complete over
	defined mailboxes, saving a bunch of typing for the hostname
	part of the URL. Should probably be extended to complete over
	open connections and possibly also folder/account hooks.

	* account.c, curs_lib.c, protos.h: Reuse mutt_get_field for
	mutt_get_field_unbuffered.

	* pager.c: Certain versions of libc may segfault during regex
	processing if given incomplete multibyte characters. Work around
	this by manually trimming the display buffer. I modified it
	somewhat to only check when the situation is most likely to occur:
	fgets has read all the way to the capacity of the buffer. Thanks
	also to Tamo for his comments.

2005-08-07 04:58:12  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* account.c, curs_lib.c, protos.h: Make username prompts
	unbuffered like password prompts are (no more folder-hook push
	garbage)

2005-08-06 22:20:55  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c, lib.c, lib.h, mutt.h, mutt_tunnel.c, sendlib.c:
	Report non-zero exit status of tunnel command. Closes: #1749.

	* imap/imap.c, imap/util.c, init.h, mutt.h, pop_lib.c: Replace
	pointless imap_force_ssl option with ssl_force_tls, which
	requires any connection (POP or IMAP) to a remote server to
	be encrypted, and attempts to negotiate encryption even if the
	capability isn't advertised (this last bit is of dubious utility,
	but essentially harmless since the connection would otherwise
	fail anyway). Closes: #1284.

	* imap/browse.c: Kill a warning.

	* init.c: Use isalnum instead of isalpha when parsing unbraced
	environment variable names, per tamo's suggestion. Closes #2022.

	* attach.c, attach.h, browser.c, curs_main.c, mutt.h, mutt_menu.h,
	pager.h, protos.h: Move some attachment-related prototypes and
	structures into attach.h from the global headers. A small step
	towards sane dependency tracking and code cleanliness.

2005-08-04 01:15:52  brendan  (brendan)

	* compose.c: Don't unlink non-mutt files that would have been
	unlinked on send if the message is cancelled.

2005-08-03 15:34:14  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* account.c: Fix C precedence buglet in getlogin preventing it
	from actually calling getuser.

	* mutt_ssl.c: Don't double-free X509 certificates. This patch
	looks wrong, but it isn't.

2005-08-02 18:15:33  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am, po/Makefile.in.in, po/POTFILES.in: Remove
	mutt_ssl_nss.c from POTFILES.in. Also hack the makefiles to build
	keymap_alldefs.h in $(top_srcdir), since that's where xgettext
	looks. Not super clean I guess - the other alternative is to
	sed POTFILES.

	* globals.h, init.c, init.h, mutt.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_socket.c,
	mutt_ssl.h, mutt_ssl_nss.c, pop_lib.c, configure.in: Put moribund
	NSS support out to pasture.

	* compose.c, mutt.h: In compose menu, detach should be able to
	unlink files generated by mutt, but not files that existed before.

	* commands.c, pgp.c: More fiddling with PGP results. When
	rerunning PGP on a message, clear old security result bits to
	avoid confusing messages like 'decrypt failed; PGP signature
	successfully verified'.

	* pgp.c: Forget passphrase on PGP/inline decryption error,
	and improve status line messages.

	* configure.in: Make $docdir relative to $prefix, like the
	other prefixes.

	* contrib/Makefile.in, doc/Makefile.in: Be more selective about
	what to remove during uninstall. (closes #1625)

	* pgp.c: Also forget passphrase when encrypt fails, if
	signing. (closes #1025 again)

	* imap/message.c: Check that the entire message downloaded
	successfully on fetch, and don't treat a disappearing cache file
	as fatal. (closes #1483)

	* compose.c: Don't unlink attachments that you've decided not
	to send. (closes #1328)

	* pgp.c: Bump up size of PgpPass to 1024 from 256. Seems crazy,
	but it's harmless and it (closes #1207).

	* account.c: Fix password prompt for POP (more authentication
	ID fallout).

2005-08-01 22:37:22  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head: Document <backtab> key.

	* pgp.c: Automatically forget PGP passphrase on sign or decrypt
	error. (closes #1025)

	* pgp.c: Display "successfully decrypted" message instead of
	nothing. Superseded by signature verification.

	* commands.c, pgp.c: Don't report PGP signature could not be
	verified unless there really is a signature verification problem
	(not some other PGP error).

	* Makefile.am: Install system muttrc from the build directory,
	not the source directory.

	* mbox.c: Restore Sort immediately after sorting by mailbox
	order in mbox_sync_mailbox.  (closes #972)

	* doc/Makefile.in, doc/mutt.man: Insert compile-time paths to
	system resources into mutt.man. (closes #854)

	* commands.c, protos.h: Report errors occuring in
	_mutt_save_message. (closes #847)

	* globals.h, mutt.h, mutt_ssl.c, muttlib.c: Cache SSL certificates
	that have been accepted but not saved until mutt exits. (closes
	#643).	Create mutt_add_list_n for adding non-character data to
	lists, have mutt_add_list call it.

	* mx.c: Report error creating FCC when writing to IMAP
	server. Addresses #423.

	* init.c: complete :set mbox_type=<tab>. (closes #1649)

	* pager.c: The builtin pager tries to wrap a line for ever if:
	0) the line contains a space or a tab character
	 followed by a very long word, and 1) M_PAGER_NSKIP flag is
	passed to it, and 2) $smart_wrap is set. (default)

2005-07-30 04:13:07  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* curs_main.c, pager.c: When using colors, the status line of
	the index is displayed in a >bright color, even when the prefix
	"bright" is *not* given in the foreground color. The problem
	occurs when I have the following additional line:
	  color normal brightwhite black The problem is that BKGDSET's
	are missing.

	* recvattach.c: Don't refuse to delete attachments just because a
	message has been checked for "traditional" PGP encoding. (closes

	* init.c: "nospam foo" causes a segv if you have not set any
	"spam", because of a null pointer dereference.

2005-07-29 06:45:14  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Tweak a poorly-worded error message in the
	gnutls glue, pointed out by Vincent Lefevre.

	* imap/imap.c: Fix bug added in revision 3.26, where
	imap_sync_mailbox failed to check whether it was supposed to
	expunge before issuing a CLOSE.

2005-07-28 20:42:45  ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp  (roessler)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Fix mutt/2004; S/MIME user interface differences
	between GPGME and classic.

2005-07-28 19:47:40  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/auth_cram.c, imap/auth_login.c: Use mutt_account_getlogin
	instead of getuser for authentication methods that only support
	an authentication ID. As a side-effect, don't display a dangling
	authentication name pointer in getpass.

2005-07-27 15:08:43  Vincent Lefevre  <vincent@vinc17.org>  (brendan)

	* crypt-gpgme.c: Correct two typos in GPGME error messages.

	po/et.po, po/gl.po, po/lt.po, po/pt_BR.po, po/sk.po: Update
	Thomas' address in several out-of-date PO files. (closes #990)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: Silence some harmless warnings. Also,
	one day -pedantic is going to get held up on the causeway.

	* imap/command.c: More fiddling with fatal state handling. Not
	tested, and probably as wrong as what was already there.

	* muttlib.c: Rework mutt_save_confirm to support confirmappend
	with IMAP mailboxes.  I hope I got all cases right.

2005-07-26 23:57:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* imap/imap.c: Adjust imap_access so that it doesn't issue STATUS
	on the selected mailbox, and have imap_open_mailbox_append use
	imap_access instead of rolling its own.

	* muttlib.c: Typo in last commit.

	* imap/message.c, muttlib.c, protos.h: Merge full envelope from
	message fetch into original sparse envelope, instead of replacing
	it. This should be gentler on the various threading hashes and may
	(knock on wood) fix the threading segfault. Threading behaviour
	is observably better.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, main.c, protos.h, init.c: This patch
	adds an option -D to dump mutt's configuration after all
	configuration files have been read.  Changes against PW's version:
	(1) curses isn't initialized; (2) variables are dumped to stdout,
	not to stderr.

	segmentation fault in May.  There is no guarantee that this patch
	doesn't break things.  If it does, please complain to mutt-dev.

	* recvattach.c, smime.c: Fix S/MIME segmentation fault.  Bug

	* account.c, account.h, globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c: Add
	$imap_login variable to specify which user to authenticate as
	($imap_user controls which user's mail gets accessed). Currently
	this can't be specified interactively, since I can't think of
	a way to do it that wouldn't annoy users where login == user

	The lack of a rename-mailbox command for IMAP finally got too

(roessler)

	* configure.in: Give people more time to profile the inode
	sorting code; disabled by default for now.

	* globals.h, init.h, menu.c: Christoph Berg's menu_context,
	and a version of menu_move_off where that's not optional,
	but where mutt will just try to avoid moving off the bottom.
	Complain to mutt-dev if you want this to be optional.

2005-02-12 19:54:51  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>
(brendan)

	* imap/message.c, imap/util.c: Fix debian bug #275060 (editing
	on an imap server loses its flags).  Remove trailing delimiter
	from IMAP folder names.

2005-02-12 19:52:28  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* charset.c, mbyte.c: Recognize euc-jp-ms.  MORIYAMA Masayuki
	by way of TAKAHASHI Tamotsu.

(roessler)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/manual.sgml.tail, init.h, main.c:
	Trivial documentation fixes (TAKAHASHI Tamotsu, Brendan Cully,
	Paul Walker, Derek Martin).

	* editmsg.c: Partially fix debian bug #275060 (editing a message
	in a mbox loses its flags).

	* TODO: We have $include_onlyfirst.

2005-02-12 19:28:26  TAKIZAWA Takashi  <taki@luna.email.ne.jp>	(roessler)

	* muttlib.c, pager.c: column-length and byte-length are different

2005-02-12 19:19:25  Derek Martin  <invalid@pizzashack.org>  (roessler)

	* mutt.h, commands.c, curs_main.c, init.h: pgp-auto-decode: When
	$pgp_auto_decode is set, then mutt will check for traditional
	pgp on certain operations.  This is similar (but NOT identical)
	to the behavior known from PGP/MIME messages.

2005-02-12 19:12:40  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>
(roessler)

	* alias.c, doc/manual.sgml.head, globals.h, hdrline.c, init.c,
	init.h: unalternates now also adds to a list of exceptions;
	same behavior for unlists, and unsubscribe.  With some changes
	from tlr.

2005-02-11 04:12:03  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* configure.in, m4/libgnutls.m4, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: autoconf
	support for gnutls using a slightly modified version of gnutls'
	own libgnutls.m4

	* globals.h, init.h: Only enable ssl_client_cert for openssl
	(spotted by Adeodato).

2005-02-09 09:05:38  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

2005-02-08 17:23:50  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<tamo@momonga-linux.org>
(roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, mutt_idna.c: Make IDN decoding optional.

(roessler)

	* Makefile.am: http://bugs.guug.de/db/17/1769.html This is

	imap/browse.c, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c, imap/message.c,
	imap/utf7.c, protos.h: Pull config.h out of protos.h, add to
	top of every IMAP C file. This should probably be done to every
	C file, but the results need testing in case some files depend
	on the current (broken) includes.

2005-01-31 02:40:14  brendan  (brendan)

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, hcache.c, imap/imap_private.h,
	imap/message.c, m4/types.m4, protos.h: Begin removing deprecated
	autoconf 2.13 backward compatibility code.  Add AC_CHECK_TYPES
	macros for uin32/64 types, use uint64_t instead of long long in
	hcache code.

2005-01-29 19:15:07  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
(roessler)

	* hcache.c: - make hcache.c conform to mutt codingstyle - use $Id$
	CVS keyword instead of %K% BitKeeper keyword

2005-01-28 16:40:33  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* pgp.c: Adeotato points out that feof() only works after a read.
	So, we now check for an unsuccessful fgetc().

2005-01-28 14:50:31  Paul Walker  <paul@black-sun.demon.co.uk>	(roessler)

	* signal.c: Trigger window resizing code when waking up from
	suspension.

	crypt-mod-pgp-gpgme.c, crypt-mod-smime-gpgme.c, cryptglue.c,
	functions.h: gpgme integration.  See documentation for

2005-01-28 13:00:36  Adeodato Simó  <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (roessler)

	* mutt_ssl_gnutls.c: The attached mini-patch from David Mosberger
	<davidm@napali.hpl.hp.com> seems to fix a segfault in the ia64
	architecture. Via Debian Bug#285001.

2005-01-28 10:01:30  roessler  (roessler)

2005-01-27 20:38:02  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>
(roessler)

	* commands.c: 0. In compose mode, press Ctrl-t to change
	Content-Type.  1. Type "application/octet-stream" for example.
	2. Press Ctrl-t again.	3. Type "text/plain; charset=us-ascii"
	4. You will be asked "Convert to us-ascii upon sending?"
	5. Press y or n.  6. You will see a strange message:
	 "Content-Type changed to Convert to us-ascii upon sending?."

2005-01-27 20:26:52  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* pgp.c: Return an error in pgp_decrypt_part when the PGP output
	file is empty.

2005-01-27 20:17:46  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
(roessler)

	* curs_main.c: this patch doesn't raise an error if you try
	to sync an empty mailbox which makes it possible to use such a
	macro as this on an empty mailbox:

	macro index y "<sync-mailbox><change-folder>?"	macro pager y
	"<sync-mailbox><change-folder>?"

2005-01-27 19:34:50  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	whitespace-only.

2005-01-27 19:18:15  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* smime.c: Void the S/MIME passphrase before prompting
	the user to re-enter it.  Noted by TAKAHASHI Tamotsu
	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>, but with memset replaced by
	smime_void_passphrase().

2005-01-27 19:00:59  TAKAHASHI Tamotsu	<ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp>
(roessler)

	* curs_lib.c: Add terminal newline when it lacks after editing
	a message.  Originally from TAKIZAWA Takashi.

2005-01-27 18:58:14  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* Makefile.am: Include mutt_ssl_gnutls.c with the distribution.

2005-01-27 18:54:24  Marco d'Itri  <md@Linux.IT>  (roessler)

	* globals.h, imap/imap.c, imap/util.c, init.c, init.h, main.c,
	mutt.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_socket.c, mutt_ssl.h, mutt_ssl_gnutls.c,
	pop_lib.c: GNUTLS support.  Used in Debian since Nov. 2001.

2005-01-27 18:48:41  Bill Nottingham  <notting@redhat.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt_sasl.c: With SASL, expect the server to prompt for
	additional auth data if we have some to send (#129961, upstream
	#1845)

	* contrib/sample.muttrc: Changes the sample.muttrc highlight to
	catch https URLs as well.

	* color.c, main.c: Support for the "default" color in Slang.

2005-01-27 18:45:37  Florian Weimer   <fw@deneb.enyo.de>  (roessler)

	* mh.c, configure.in: Read files in maildir folders in inode
	order; this seems to reduce seek overhead on Linux.  Enabled by
	default; to disable, run configure with --disable-inodesort.
	(By way of Mario d'Itri.)

2005-01-27 18:28:42  Marco d'Itri  <md@Linux.IT>  (roessler)

	* pgp.c: Improved good signature check.

	* contrib/gpg.rc, pgpinvoke.c: Make the default Muttrc work
	out the box for people using gnupg-agent.  Wrote and applied a
	one-line patch to make the %?p? conditional escape work correctly,
	patch forwarded upstream. (Closes: #277646)

	* pgpewrap.c: Don't segfault when invoked without any arguments.

	* contrib/gpg.rc, pgp.c: Evaluate gpg's machine-parseable status
	messages.

	* smime_keys.pl: Add some sanity checks to smime_keys.pl.

	* contrib/gpg.rc: A gpg command line contains both --verbose
	and --no-verbose, remove the first.

2005-01-26 14:33:08  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* status.c: And, thinking about it further, this should just be
	an empty string, not "(null)".

	* status.c: The last Context->pattern fix was still crap.
	Ooooops. (Thanks Ralf.)

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, globals.h, hcache.c, imap/imap.c,

	* status.c: * status.c: A variant of

	Spotted by Ralf Wildenhues <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>.

2005-01-17 02:24:49  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* cvslog2changelog.pl: cvs log emits a timezone after the hour,
	at least here. Adjust date regexp to handle that case.

2005-01-15 17:45:01  Adeodato Simó   <asp16@alu.ua.es>  (brendan)

	* po/cs.po: Major translation updates forgotten in mutt-po.
	(I missed cs in the last commit).

2005-01-15 08:01:35  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (brendan)

	* Makefile.am: Update commit targets to work when builddir !=
	srcdir.

2005-01-15 07:43:30  Adeodato Simó  <asp16@alu.ua.es>	(brendan)

	* po/sv.po, po/ca.po, po/de.po, po/it.po: i18n updates.

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/mutt.man, doc/muttrc.man.head,
	init.h: Sundry documentation nits fixed.  Debian #210679, #254294,

2005-01-11 12:15:13  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* doc/manual.sgml.head, doc/muttrc.man.head: Document send2-hook.

	* send.c: send2-hook should also be executed after the first
	time the message is edited by the user.

2005-01-09 15:35:51  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* doc/muttbug.man, muttbug.sh.in: Replace muttbug and its

	bug tracking system.

2004-12-21 09:46:24  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

2004-12-07 19:50:04  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* compose.c, hook.c, init.c, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Add
	send2-hook and fix alternates handling.

2004-11-19 16:16:51  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (roessler)

	* doc/manual.sgml.tail, doc/manual.sgml.head: Document
	tag-prefix-cond.

2004-11-08 08:43:17  Ralf Wildenhues  <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>
(roessler)

	* imap/imap_private.h: Having a signed one-bit bitfield is quite
	odd -- its value is either 0 or -1.  Although the current code
	is not broken because it doesn't test equality to 1, IMHO it's
	better not to use that.

	* imap/message.c: There's a size_t in imap_append_message not
	printed out portably.

2004-11-02 13:30:58  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* browser.c, buffy.c, check_sec.sh, commands.c, edit.c,

	lib.c, lib.h, mutt_ssl.c, muttlib.c, recvcmd.c, url.c:
	safe_strcat, safe_strncat.  Thanks to Ulf H. for noting the
	wrong use of strncat in part of the mutt code base.

	* smime.c: Fix bad code in smime_get_field_from_db.  Problem noted
	by Ulf Härnhammar <Ulf.Harnhammar.9485@student.uu.se>.

2004-09-29 11:27:33  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* lib.c: Fix mutt_unlink race condition for systems without
	O_NOFOLLOW.  Noted by Jarno Huuskonen <Jarno.Huuskonen@uku.fi>.

2004-09-07 08:09:39  Matthias Andree  <matthias.andree@gmx.de>	(roessler)

	* prepare: Fix parameter passing.

2004-08-31 15:41:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>
(roessler)

	* configure.in: Add AC_GNU_SOURCE.

	* recvattach.c: Remove *two* layers of S/MIME from messages
	before building the attachment tree.  A generic solution would
	remove intransparent encodings all the way down the tree.

2004-08-30 20:10:10  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* compose.c: Only print additional information related to PGP
	in case the current message is indeed to be encrypted/signed
	with PGP.

	* globals.h, init.h, mutt_sasl.c, mutt_ssl.c: Here's a patch
	to allow mutt to use SSL client certificates to authenticate
	itself. To use, set ssl_client_cert to the path to your
	certificate file (containing both the certificate and the private
	key). It works with the SASL EXTERNAL authentication mechanism,
	so you'll need to have SASL enabled as well.

2004-08-30 20:03:35  Thomas Glanzmann  <sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>
(roessler)

	* init.c: Fix a memory leak in the generic spam detection code.

	* muttlib.c, protos.h: This wipes duplicated code, which I

	* headers.c: as of current cvs, setting "PGP: E" (or similar)
	when header-editing a message does not work. the OP is set
	(ENCRYPT, SIGN, whatever) but APPLICATION_PGP is missing.

2004-08-16 21:36:38  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* imap/imap.c: If STARTTLS fails to complete the SSL handshake,
	the error is not propagated and mutt will attempt to log in
	anyway, probably causing an infinite block on read. The attached
	patch closes the socket in this case, and propagates the error
	properly.

	* imap/auth_sasl.c: The attached patch causes mutt to attempt
	the next method in imap_authenticators if the previous method
	failed, even if the server reported that the method was
	available. Previously mutt would give up if any authentication
	method failed.

2004-08-16 21:34:22  Moritz Schulte   <moritz@g10code.com>  (roessler)

	* compose.c: Only print "Encrypt with" field in case the used
	S/MIME modules supports this feature.

	Revisit Editor/Visual some time.

2004-07-14 05:19:15  Elmar Hoffmann  <mutt-dev-ml@elho.net>  (roessler)

	* init.h, mutt.h, thread.c: By default Mutt hides the subject
	of messages in the thread tree that have the same subject as
	their parent or closest previously displayed sibling. This patch
	makes this optional, introducing the hide_thread_subject boolean
	setting which defaults to the old behaviour.

(roessler)

	* copy.c, copy.h, handler.c, init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Fix a cvs
	commit SNAFU: This commit undoes the include_onlyfirst patch,
	but leaves the generic spam detection by David Champion in place
	(which, erroneously, hadn't been committed automatically).

2004-07-14 04:16:58  ttakah@lapis.plala.or.jp  (roessler)

	be identical.

	* init.c, sendlib.c: Add some debugging code, and rewrite the
	previously-ununderstandable mutt_remove_duplicates.  (All this
	done on the search for a problem that ultimately turned out to
	be a configuration issue. Still, the changed code could come in
	handy some day.)

	* smime.c: Change S/MIME send menu behavior to xor instead of or,
	so it behaves the same way as the PGP send menu.

2004-06-17 20:36:13  Moritz Schulte  <moritz@g10code.com>  (roessler)

	mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, mutt_curses.h, pgp.c, pgp.h, smime.c,
	smime.h: This is the sequel to the crypto modularization changes
	I did on 2003-01-21.  Moritz added another abstraction layer
	which cleans up the code and allows the crypto modules to use
	their own option menu.	Everything should work as it used to
	but is now in a really good shape for part III, the Return of
	the GnuPG Easy Makers. -wk

	* crypt-mod-pgp-classic.c, crypt-mod-smime-classic.c, crypt-mod.c,
	crypt-mod.h: New files.

	* smime.c (smime_valid_passphrase, smime_send_menu): New

	Declare: crypt_pgp_valid_passphrase, crypt_pgp_send_menu,
	crypt_smime_valid_passphrase, crypt_smime_send_menu, crypt_init.
	Adjust WithCrypto definition since the GPGME backend does not
	exclude anymore the other `classic' backends.  (KEYFLAG_ISX509):
	New symbol.  * mutt.h (enum): New symbol: OPTCRYPTUSEGPGME.
	(struct body): New member: is_signed_data, warnsig.  * main.c
	(main): Call crypt_init.  * keymap.c (km_get_table): Support for
	MENU_KEY_SELECT_PGP and MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.	(Menus): Added
	entries fuer MENU_KEY_SELECT_PGP and MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.
	(km_init): Create bindings for MENU_KEY_SELECT_PGP and
	MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.	* keymap.h (enum): New enum symbols:
	MENU_KEY_SELECT_PGP, MENU_KEY_SELECT_SMIME.  * init.h:
	New configuration variable: crypt_use_gpgme.  * compose.c
	(pgp_send_menu, smime_send_menu): Removed functions, they are now
	contained in the crypto backend modules.  (mutt_compose_menu):
	Use crypt_pgp_send_menu and crypt_smime_send_menu instead
	pgp_send_menu and smime_send_menu.  * cryptglue.c: Slightly
	rewritten in order to make use of the module mechanism used to
	access crypto backends.  * curs_lib.c (mutt_need_hard_redraw):
	New function.  * crypt.c (crypt_forget_passphrase): Adjust
	for new crypto backend interface.  (crypt_valid_passphrase):
	Stripped, use calls to crypt_pgp_valid_passphrase and
	crypt_smime_valid_passphrase.

	* commands.c, curs_main.c, mutt.h, mutt_crypt.h, pager.c,
	recvattach.c: A belated fix for #1808 (Debian #233106): Make
	sure check-traditional-pgp doesn't leave the pager context

	* muttlib.c: Change the logic in mutt_open_read to only
	catch directories -- mutt may legitimately read devices (think
	/dev/null) or named pipes. Also delegate error reporting to the

	* mbox.c: Hi, off_t is a 64-bit number (like on Mac OS X/darwin),
	the percentages don't show right while mutt is reading/parsing
	a mailbox.  Here's a patch (against 1.5.6i) to fix that.

2004-02-07 21:36:41  David Yitzchak Cohen
<lists+mutt_devs@bigfatdave.com>  (roessler)

	* init.c, muttlib.c: Looking at the code, the problem is pretty
	obvious.  A recent patch to init.c (the one that was supposed
	to prevent Mutt from silently failing to read nonexistant RC
	files, IIRC) changed source_rc() to stat(2) the RC "file" before
	trying to mutt_open_read() it.	There's only one problem here:
	source_rc() has no way of knowing whether or not its "file"
	is a file or a command.  I'm attaching a patch that fixes the
	problem in what I believe is the right way.

2004-02-01 18:00:16  Mike Schiraldi  <1074468571@schiraldi.org>
(roessler)

	* init.c: As you all know, running "mutt -F foo.rc" will have
	mutt read foo.rc as its config file. However, there is a bug --
	if you specify a directory (like accidentally typing "mutt -F
	/etc/mutt") mutt will silently ignore the flag and leave you
	wondering why it isn't working.

	Emil Sit posted a patch for this in March of 2002, but it seems
	to have slipped through the cracks. Here's the patch again;
	please consider it for inclusion.

	* postpone.c: I've attached a patch for bug number 1036, as
	reported at http://bugs.guug.de/db/pa/lmutt.html ("segfault
	when more than one msg is postponed").	This is a patch against
	mutt 1.4.1.

	As it was previously left, no one could reproduce it.  The problem
	occurs because sorting is disabled when opening the postponed
	folder, but the Sort global variable still tells mutt to use
	whatever sorting algorithm the $sort config option indicates.
	Eventually, the code would get to mutt_messages_in_thread and
	try to dereference a NULL thread object, causing the segfault.

	* imap/imap.c: 1595: My guess is this bug is caused by
	mlarson@verisign.com's patch to check for UNSEEN rather than

	in a mailbox either new or old, mutt will think it has new mail.

	The attached patch reverts that change. Let me know if it solves

2003-07-29 10:11:05  Edmund GRIMLEY EVANS  <edmundo@rano.org>  (roessler)

	* pager.c: It seems that Solaris has an incorrect implementation
	of mbrtowc: when there is an encoding error and mbrtowc returns
	(size_t)(-1) no value should be stored in *pwc (the first
	argument), as I understand it, but here mbrtowc is storing 8
	when presented with the bytes "\xc8\x4d".

	However, relying on mbrtowc not to store anything in *pwc when
	there is an error is a bit silly; it makes sense to look at
	the return value. So, the following patch should be applied if
	Pawel can confirm that it fixes the problem. I've tested it and
	it worked for me with glibc's mbrtowc.

	makedoc.c, muttlib.c, pattern.c, rfc2047.c, rfc2231.c, rfc822.c,
	strcasecmp.c, url.c: Some functions/macros like isspace take an
	int and require the argument to have the value of an unsigned char
	(or EOF). Under Solaris, gcc complains when the argument is a char
	(as this is a possible bug, on platforms where char is signed,
	like Solaris). The attached patch fixes such problems (well,
	perhaps I've changed more than necessary, but this doesn't hurt).

2003-07-22 12:56:38  dshaw@jabberwocky.com  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c: When encrypting a message to a user that has more
	than one subkey, at least one of which is revoked or expired,
	mutt treats the entire key as unusable rather than just the
	subkey(s) in question.

	* account.c, account.h, imap/auth_sasl.c, imap/imap.c: I noticed
	that my mutt hung when I tried SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication
	(I'm not sure when this started). I believe this patch should
	solve that problem in a reliable way.

	This patch also attempts to reuse connections even when
	authentication fails, instead of just throwing away a perfectly
	good socket.

	* curs_lib.c, enter.c, keymap.c, keymap.h, mutt.h, mutt_curses.h,
	mutt_ssl.c: This patch redoes yesterday's unbuffered input
	patch. Now it uses a pseudo-option, which means less mess to carry
	down the call stack.  It also made it much easier to have the SSL
	certificate menu be unbuffered, which it is now. So push commands
	won't annoy you when entering passwords or accepting certificates.

	* curs_main.c, globals.h, imap/command.c, imap/imap.c,
	imap/imap.h, imap/imap_private.h, imap/util.c, mx.c: The attached
	patch should keep all opened IMAP connections alive, no matter
	what mailbox you are currently in. With the patch that got
	committed yesterday, this should close bug 1523.

	(There was a typo in that patch. This one supersedes it.)

	pgp_sort_keys is set in a configuration file, but mutt is compiled
	without PGP support.

	* gnupgparse.c: Fix PGP subkey handling when looking at key
	capabilities.  This should take care of the recent "mutt does
	not see all keys" problems.

	* recvattach.c: view-attachments does not extract the message
	within a x-pkcs7-mime if it's only signed, but not encrypted.
	Such a message results, for example, from a decrypt-save if the
	message was previously encrypted and signed.

2003-05-13 12:43:45  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c, pgppubring.c: Currently, mutt uses the OpenPGP key
	algorithm to determine the capabilities of the key.  For example,
	in mutt, a key of type 1 (RSA) can both encrypt & sign.  This is
	not correct as per OpenPGP, however, where the capabilities of
	the key are determined by both the algorithm and key capability
	flags that are set on the key.	This can lead to user confusion
	when their RSA encrypt-only or sign-only key is listed for both
	signing and encryption in mutt.

	GnuPG lists these flags in key listings, so it is easy to take
	advantage of them.  Here is a patch to use the flags, as well
	as provide the flags in pgpring.  Note that the pgp+pgpring
	users won't see any change since the flags there are based on
	the key algorithm as they are now, but the GnuPG users will see
	an improvement.

2003-05-03 20:07:40  Dan Nelson  <dnelson@allantgroup.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt.h, muttlib.c: Fix #1558.  (mutt_expand_fmt rewrite;
	OPT_MAX wasn't maximal.)

2003-04-15 13:17:05  René Clerc  <rene@clerc.nl>  (roessler)

	* compose.c: Fix two more cases in which ctrl-G is interpreted

(roessler)

	* compose.c: The "sign (a)s" code strips the pgp application
	bit causing drawing issues in redraw_crypt_lines().  Other bits
	(well bit = encrypt) are ignored as a result.  I've only tested
	with pgp, but the same problem exists in the smime code too.
	This inline patch (against cvs head revision) fixes the problem.

2003-04-14 09:09:53  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* init.h, mutt.h, send.c: Fix the PGP / S/MIME selection mess
	in send.c.  This patch adds two new configuration variables,
	$crypt_autopgp and $crypt_autsmime.  Both are set to "yes"
	by default.  By turning them off, you can disable the automatic
	selection of one or both mechanisms.  (Useful when your mutt is
	PGP- and S/MIME enabled, but you only use, say S/MIME.)

	* lib.c: Avoid a division by zero.

	* color.c: Make sure has_colors() is only invoked when OPTNOCURSES
	is unset.  This fixes a segmentation fault on RH 8.0 which was
	observed by Matt Larson <mlarson@verisign.com>.

	* browser.c, enter.c, imap/imap.c, lib.c, mutt_idna.c, mx.c,

	* init.h, mutt.h, pgp.c: Here is the pgp_check_exit patch
	updated for 1.5.4.  This patch adds the pgp_check_exit option
	(enabled by default) that causes mutt to check the exit code
	of the PGP subprocess.	A non-zero exit code means that the
	subprocess failed and mutt will not continue to send the message.

	This is needed as in certain cases, PGP or GnuPG can fail to
	completely process a document (say, if the gpg.conf file is
	mangled, which is how I discovered the problem).  Without an
	exit code check, mutt will continue anyway and send the half
	processed file.

	* buffy.c, parse.c: - buffy.c (test_last_status_new): Fix memory
	  leak.  Envelope structure allocated by mutt_read_rfc822_header()
	  was never deallocated.

	- parse.c (mutt_read_rfc822_header): Comment added about
	  needing deallocate envelope structure returned by
	  mutt_read_rfc822_header().

	* mutt_idna.c: (mutt_addr_for_display): Fix memory leak.  `user'
	and `domain' buffers was never deallocated.

	(mbox_to_udomain): Fix memory leak.  `scratch' buffer was not
	deallocated when `mbx' doesn't contain '@'. Also rewritten for
	allocating memory only when needed and only how many as needed.

2003-03-12 13:00:03  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* copy.c, sendlib.c: We need to re-format address headers instead
	of just decoding them.

2003-03-07 14:55:53  Brendan Cully  <brendan@kublai.com>  (roessler)

	* mutt_sasl.c: The global callbacks set up in sasl_client_init
	are not copied by the SASL library, so they can't be allocated
	on the stack. This is the case with both versions of the SASL
	library, and I frankly don't understand why it hasn't caused
	problems before. Since it segfaults reliably on OS X for me now,
	I thought a patch would be in order.

2003-03-07 08:23:27  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* crypt.c, pgp.h: Don't use functions without importing the

	* mutt_idna.c: It seems like libidn doesn't like to translate
	NULL pointers.

2003-03-07 07:52:49  Jim Mock  <mij@soupnazi.org>  (roessler)

	protos.h, query.c, recvcmd.c, rfc822.c, rfc822.h, send.c,
	sendlib.c: IDN support for e-mail messages.  Things should work
	automagically once you have the GNU IDN library available from
	ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libidn/ installed.	For IDN's which
	can't be losslessly recoded to your local character set, mutt
	should automatically fall back to using the ASCII representation.
	There's probably a considerable number of bugs in this, and the
	code may, at this point, not even compile on machines without
	libidn.  Will start working on that ASAP.

	* contrib/sample.muttrc, doc/manual.sgml.head, recvcmd.c,
	commands.c, init.h, mutt.h: Introduce a new option named
	$bounce, and fix some inconsistencies in the messages created
	when bouncing.	Based on work done by Thomas Glanzmann
	<sithglan@stud.uni-erlangen.de>.

2003-02-25 22:00:38  Thomas Roessler  <roessler@does-not-exist.org>

	* commands.c, recvcmd.c: Fix some (too lazy and tired to do all)
	of the inconsistencies between message and attachment bouncing.

	* pgpmicalg.c: 3156 defined several micalg values (pgp-md5,
	pgp-sha1, etc.)  Since then, three more hashes have been assigned
	numbers in 2440bis.  Here is a patch to add values for pgp-sha256,
	pgp-sha384, and pgp-sha512 so mutt can properly handle them.

2003-01-23 22:05:02  Nathan Dushman  <nhd+mutt@andrew.cmu.edu>	(roessler)

	* pop_auth.c: SASL2 support for popo_auth.c.

	* curs_main.c, flags.c, imap/imap.c, pager.c: The attached
	patch provides improved support for IMAP ACLs (on servers that
	support them).	This means that mutt will now write the Seen
	flag in mailboxes that allow it, even if the mailbox doesn't
	allow other changes.

	 code and prepare for other backends.  - Support gpg-agent by
	 not asking for a passphrase - autconf cleanups.

	This is just a start and probably we need a couple of other things
	to do. One drawback is that the help menu does always list all
	crypto realted stuff even when configured for no crypto at all.
	Same goes for the configure options but I consider thsi a feature:
	It allows to use the same .muttrc for different versions of mutt -
	at least during development, this is an advantage.  This all might
	be fixed but requires some changes to the configuration system.

	Note, the use of the WithCrypto macro - it enables the compiler
	to do dead-code-elimination depending on the configured backend.
	This is better readable than all the nested ifdefs.  I did some
	short tests and it seems to work, althoug mutt's size does not
	change largely when compiled w/o crypto.

	cryptglue.c is new as a warpper to all crypto calls; some are
	still in crypt.c but they should eventually also be wrapped.
	We don't use function pointers to keep a path to use dlopen or
	runtime configured backends.  crypt.h is also new and replaces
	pgp.h and smime.h in most files (except for the backend).

	* pgppubring.c: Don't make a "hard" transition to the new GnuPG
	syntax in pgpring.  This change undoes one of David Shaw's
	changes which were just committed.

2003-01-09 17:24:41  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>  (roessler)

	* gnupgparse.c, pgppubring.c: The latest GnuPG has new abilities
	to work with disabled keys.  Part of this change will eventually
	involve moving the 'd' that indicates a disabled key to a
	different part of the key listing.

	To smooth this transition, as of version 1.2.2, GnuPG will
	start giving the 'd' in both places (and will do this for a good
	long time).

	Here is a patch so mutt will accept either the old or new syntax.

2003-01-09 17:23:23  dshaw@jabberwocky.com  (roessler)

	Martin Dietze <herbert@the-little-red-haired-girl.org> notes that
	mutt may currently build IMAP URLs like imap://exchange//herbert
	for FCCs.  The fix in this patch is to include a function named
	mutt_concat_path which concatenates path elements, but avoids
	the creation of double slashes.  (These don't create problems
	when you're just accessing the file system, but apparently thy
	do cause problems with IMAP.)

	- you can now specify the octal code of a key in a bind or
	  macro function, using the syntax <NNN>.  Eg, bind index <541>
	  show-version This allows you to bind to a function key for
	  which Mutt doesn't have a friendly name associated with it.

	- adds a what-key function which allows you to press a key and
	  have mutt show you the decimal/octal value.  (not bound to
	  anything by default)

	to use version 2 of the Cyrus SASL library; all changes are
	ifdef'd so as not to break SASLv1 support. This includes a patch
	to configure.in to allow the choice between v1 and v2, but someone

	* alias.c, init.c, protos.h: patch-1.5-tlr.alias-parse.1 -
	extension of patch-1.5.1-me.aliascheck.1

	This patch catches the same kind of bad alias names caught by
	Michael's patch.  There are some extensions:

	1. Mutt makes sure that it doesn't _suggest_ bad names to
	the user.  2. If a name is bad, the user is informed, and may
	elect to fix the
	   name.  In this case, mutt will automatically suggest a fixed
	   version.
	3. If the user insists in the bad name, it's written into the
	   aliases file with proper quoting.
	4. When mutt parses the aliases file, it now uses the normal
	   tokenizer routines in order to properly handle quoted alias
	   names.

	'Catch' is good but also to encode it is better. It may have
	been too late (sorry for that) so I fixed it. I don't know why
	the current source only escapes lines that actually begin with
	'from' or 'From' followed by some text. I think that escaping
	'from' or 'From' on a single line should be done, too.

	Not a big deal, anyways.

	* m4/gssapi.m4: Okay, two bugs here. One's an oversight of mine
	in my previous patch, where I tried to use "[hH]" as Bourne code
	while m4 had quoting set to ([, ]) -- this probably makes mutt
	mis-detect Heimdal after all.

	The other is not mine (i.e., it's in cvs now) and it makes mutt
	overstrike $LIBS if Heimdal or MIT Kerberos is detected. This is
	a problem for anyone who needs -lnsl -lsocket, in particular. I
	was fixing this by hand during late 1.3.x releases, as I didn't
	have time to track it down....

	Here's a patch against the current (unpatched) 1.5 cvs copy of
	m4/gssapi.m4. It probably should go into both branches. Sorry
